"AbstractBackground: Acupuncture has been proven to be effective as an alternative therapy in treating migraine, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of the treatment remain unclear. This study investigated possible neurochemical responses to acupuncture treatment.Patients and methods: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging was used to investigate biochemical levels pre- and post-acupuncture treatment. Participants (N=45) included subjects diagnosed with: 1) migraine without aura; 2) cervicogenic headache; and 3) healthy controls. Participants in the two patient groups received verum acupuncture using acupoints that target migraine without aura but not cervicogenic headache, while the healthy controls received a sham treatment. All participants had magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans before and after the acupuncture therapy. Levels of brain metabolites were examined in relation to clinical headache assessment scores.Results: A significant increase in N-acetylaspartate/creatine was observed in bilateral thalamus in migraine without aura after the acupuncture treatment, which was significantly correlated with the headache intensity score.Conclusion: The data demonstrate brain biochemical changes underlying the effect of acupuncture treatment of migraine.","Gu T, Lin L, Jiang Y, Chen J, D'Arcy RC, Chen M, Song X",J Pain Res. 2018 Apr 27;11:889-900. doi: 10.2147/JPR.S162696. eCollection  2018.,Acupuncture therapy in treating migraine: results of a magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29740217
"AbstractThe success of naturalistic or therapeutic neuroregeneration likely depends on an internal milieu that facilitates the survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of stem cells and their assimilation into neural networks. Migraine attacks are an integrated sequence of physiological processes that may protect the brain from oxidative stress by releasing growth factors, suppressing apoptosis, stimulating neurogenesis, encouraging mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing the production of oxidants, and upregulating antioxidant defenses. Thus, the migraine attack may constitute a physiologic environment conducive to stem cells. In this paper, key components of migraine are reviewed - neurogenic inflammation with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, plasma protein extravasation, platelet activation, release of serotonin by platelets and likely by the dorsal raphe nucleus, activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and, in migraine aura, cortical spreading depression - along with their potential neurorestorative aspects. The possibility is considered of using these components to facilitate successful stem cell transplantation. Potential methods for doing so are discussed, including chemical stimulation of the TRPA1 ion channel, conjoint activation of a subset of migraine components, invasive and noninvasive deep brain stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus, transcranial focused ultrasound, and stimulation of the Zusanli (ST36) acupuncture point.",Borkum JM,Neural Regen Res. 2018 Apr;13(4):609-615. doi: 10.4103/1673-5374.230275.,Harnessing migraines for neural regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29722303
"AbstractBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A migraine is one of the primary headache disorders. Acupuncture has been widely used to treat migraine. Furthermore, electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been also used to treat migraine. However, there has been no systematic review by assessing efficacy and safety of EA on migraine. This protocol is developed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the evidences related to the effectiveness and safety of EA on migraine.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol follows the guideline according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The following seven databases will be searched from their inception to September 2016: Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, OASIS, the Korean Traditional Knowledge Portal, the Korean Medical Database and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). This Systemic review will include only the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture therapy on migraine. We will perform data extraction, study selection, assessment with risk of bias and data analysis. The primary outcomes of this study are headache pain intensity and the total treatment effective rate. And this protocol study for systematic reviews, the approval of IRB was not required.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review will not need ethical approval, because it doesn't involve human beings. We will publish this systematic review electronically in a peer-reviewed journal. This systematic review will give healthcare practitioners good practical guide and information for treating migraine.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPEROCRD42018085099.","Chu H, Seo J, Kim C, Moon Y, Kang DG, Lee HS, Sung KK, Lee S",Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Apr;97(17):e9999. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009999.,Electroacupuncture for migraine protocol for a systematic review of controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703068
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To make comparisons between acupuncture and acupressure for preventing menstrual migraine (MM).METHODS: MM is one kind of migraine associated with females' menses. It is often associated with increased menstrual distress and disability, leading to decreased daily activity and quality of life. A randomized and controlled pilot study with three groups: verum acupuncture (VA) group, acupressure (AP) group, and control acupuncture (CA) group. The study lasted for seven cycle-months, with a 1-cycle-month baseline observation (T1), a 3-cycle-month intervention (three times per cycle-month) (T2-T4), and a 3-cycle-month follow-up (T5-T7). Outcome measures were number of migraine days, average and peak pain, total duration period of MM, and percentage of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in the number of MM days.RESULTS: A total of 18 participants were included in the analysis (VA, n = 7; AP, n = 6; CA, n = 5). Both VA and AP were significantly more effective than CA for reducing MM days during the intervention period. Both VA and AP tended to be more effective than CA for reducing peak pain during the intervention period. No significant differences for the outcomes were observed among VA, AP, and CA during the follow-up period. No serious adverse events were reported.DISCUSSION: Results of the pilot study suggest that both VA and AP could be considered as alternative and safe prophylactic interventions for MM.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: We applied C2 peripheral nerve field stimulation using electroacupuncture (EA-C2-PNfS) for primary headache, and investigated its clinical effectiveness.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four primary headache patients (10 men, 44 women) with a mean age of 48.6 ± 15.0 years underwent EA-C2-PNfS for three months. We used questionnaires to assess outcomes; pain intensity (11-point numerical rating scale [NRS]), quality of daily life (Headache Impact Test [HIT-6]), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale [SDS]). Monthly headache days and acute headache medication days were obtained from diaries.RESULTS: The headache intensity significantly declined after the EA-C2-PNfS with reduction of NRS pain scale; 7.4 ± 1.9 at baseline, 4.9 ± 2.9 at three month (p < 0.001). Both HIT-6 and SDS showed significant improvement (p < 0.001). Some patients showed moderate depression in SDS before treatment, that was alleviated in patients with tension-type headache after the EA-C2-PNfS. Monthly headache days significantly decreased from 18.0 ± 9.0 at one month to 14.0 ± 10.2 at three months (p < 0.001), accompanied with reduction of the monthly acute headache medication days from 8.0 ± 6.7 to 6.4 ± 6.5 (p = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: EA-C2-PNfS was successfully used for reducing severity and disability in primary headache patients. We conclude that EA-C2-PNfS is a favorable option for medically intractable primary headache as less-invasive neuromodulation.© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society.","Ishiyama S, Shibata Y, Ayuzawa S, Matsushita A, Matsumura A",Neuromodulation. 2018 Mar 22. doi: 10.1111/ner.12772.

AbstractThis issue includes several excellent observational studies prompted by physicians' clinical questions. Many people use lots of menthol cough drops-does the menthol overall lengthen the cough duration? When should we intensify treatment of older individuals with diabetes? Do occipital nerve blocks work for acute migraine headaches? Did you know that the plantar fascia can rupture? What happens to those patients with chest pain but low pretest probability for serious cardiac disease who are admitted to the hospital? Acupuncture can work well-for the patients-but how can we incorporate it into the usual pace of the family medicine office? Is it a win-lose situation when medical assistant roles are expanded? How many practice sites do physicians have and does that make a difference in the number or type of health personnel shortage areas?

"AbstractNumerous fMRI studies have confirmed functional abnormalities in resting-state brain networks in migraine patients. However, few studies focusing on causal relationships of pain-related brain networks in migraine have been conducted. This study aims to explore the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients.Twenty two MWoA patients and 17 matched healthy subjects were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scanning. Independent component analysis was used to extract pain-related brain networks, and Granger causality analysis to characterize the difference of Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks was employed.Seven pain-related brain networks were identified, and MwoA patients showed more complex Granger causality connections in comparison with healthy subjects. Two-sample t test results displayed that there was the significant difference between right-frontoparietal network (RFPN) and executive control network (ECN).This study indicates that the specific intrinsic brain Granger causality connectivity among pain-related networks in MwoA patients are affected after long-term migraine attacks.","Ning Y, Zheng R, Li K, Zhang Y, Lyu D, Jia H, Ren Y, Zou Y",Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Mar;97(10):e0102. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010102.,The altered Granger causality connection among pain-related brain networks in migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517685
"AbstractPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Menopause is a life-changing event in numerous ways. Many women with migraine hold hope that the transition to the climacteric state will coincide with a cessation or improvement of migraine. This assumption is based mainly on common lay perceptions as well as assertions from many in the healthcare community. Unfortunately, evidence suggests this is far from the rule. Many women turn to a general practitioner or a headache specialist for prognosis and management. A natural instinct is to manipulate the offending agent, but in some cases, this approach backfires, or the concern for adverse events outweighs the desire for a therapeutic trial, and other strategies must be pursued. Our aim was to review the frequency and type of headache syndromes associated with menopause, to review the evidence for specific treatments for headache associated with menopause, and to provide management recommendations and prognostic guidance.RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed both clinic- and population-based studies assessing headache associated with menopause. Headache in menopause is less common than headache at earlier ages but can present a unique challenge. Migraine phenotype predominates, but presentations can vary or be due to secondary causes. Other headache types, such as tension-type headache (TTH) and cluster headache (CH) may also be linked to or altered by hormonal changes. There is a lack of well-defined diagnostic criteria for headache syndromes associated with menopause. Women with surgical menopause often experience a worse course of disease status than those with natural menopause. Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) often results in worsening of migraine and carries potential for increased cardiovascular and ischemic stroke risk. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with migraine with aura (MA) may increase the risk of ischemic stroke; however, the effect is likely dose-dependent. Some medications used in the prophylaxis of migraine may be useful in ameliorating the vasomotor and mood effects of menopause, including venlafaxine, escitalopram, paroxetine, and gabapentin. Other non-medication strategies such as acupuncture, vitamin E, black cohosh, aerobic exercise, and yoga may also be helpful in reducing headache and/or vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The frequency and type of headache associated with menopause is variable, though migraine and TTH are most common. Women may experience a worsening, an improvement, or no change in headache during the menopausal transition. Treatment may be limited by vascular risks or other medical and psychiatric factors. We recommend using medications with dual benefit for migraine and vasomotor symptoms including venlafaxine, escitalopram, paroxetine, and gabapentin, as well as non-medication strategies such as acupuncture, vitamin E, black cohosh, aerobic exercise, and yoga. If HRT is pursued, continuous (rather than cyclical) physiological doses should be used, transdermal route of administration is recommended, and the patient should be counseled on the potential for increased risk of adverse events (AEs). Concomitant use of a progestogen decreases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with ERT. Biological mechanisms are incompletely understood, and there is a lack of consensus on how to define and classify headache in menopause. Further research to focus on pathophysiology and nuanced management is desired.","Lauritsen CG, Chua AL, Nahas SJ",Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2018 Mar 6;20(4):7. doi: 10.1007/s11940-018-0492-7.,Current Treatment Options: Headache Related to Menopause-Diagnosis and Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29508091
"AbstractTemporal arteritis is a form of vasculitis that involves the large and medium-diameter arteries and leads to progressive headache. Symptoms may be accompanied by vision disorder, subfebrile temperature, fatigue, lack of appetite, weight loss, sweating and joint pains. While cortisone therapy reduces the symptoms, its effects in terms of improving quality of life are limited. We elected to benefit from the effects of acupuncture in order to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life in a case of temporal arteritis, a chronic disease. A 75-year-old woman presented with pain on both sides of the head. The pain occurred in the form of agonizing attacks 2-3 times a week. Accompanying neck pain was present, together with continuous lethargy and fatigue. Physical examination revealed decreased cutaneous elasticity and muscle mass, and a depressive mood state was present. The patient was first administered six sessions of acupuncture therapy directed toward the migraine etiology. When no response was achieved, we investigated temporal and parietal region points associated with headache in the literature. Points GB1,8,18, ST8, SI19 and BL8 were added to the treatment. A decrease in the pain attacks and their frequency occurred following acupuncture therapy. In conclusion, while cortisone is the first preference in the treatment of temporal arteritis, we think that acupuncture aimed at the cause of accompanying symptoms can also be useful.",Sezgin Y,J Acupunct Meridian Stud. 2017 Dec 26. pii: S2005-2901(17)30228-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jams.2017.12.002.

"AbstractIntroduction: Surgical menopause is associated with symptoms that can affect a woman's quality of life (QoL) significantly. These symptoms include migraines, insomnia, and depression. Case: A 45-year-old Caucasian female presented at an acupuncture clinic. Fourteen years prior, she had been diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma, underwent ovariectomy, and was prescribed hormone replacement therapy. Deteriorating QoL caused her to seek acupuncture for migraines, insomnia, and depression. The outcomes sought for treatment of this case included intensity, duration, and frequency of migraines, insomnia, and depression, as well as her QoL. The outcome measures were estimated monthly throughout her treatment. Each was rated on a numeric scale of 0-10 (0 = ""the lowest possible"" and 10 = ""the worst imaginable""). At baseline, the patient rated the intensity, duration, and frequency of each complaint as 10. She was treated with 60-minute, I Ching Balance Acupuncture (ICBA) sessions once per week for 7 months. Results: This acupuncture treatment did not cause any adverse events, pain, or discomfort. Her migraines, insomnia, and depression decreased to a great extent. In addition, this patient reported considerable improvement in her QoL. The improvement in her QoL was inversely related to the intensity, duration, and frequency of her complaints throughout her acupuncture treatment. Conclusions: This patient reported a considerable improvement in all the outcome measures. She completed the treatment after experiencing great improvement in her QoL. Additional, larger-scale studies are warranted to investigate the effects of ICBA.",Kotlyar A,Med Acupunct. 2018 Feb 1;30(1):41-45. doi: 10.1089/acu.2017.1249.,"I Ching Balance Acupuncture Treatment of Migraines, Insomnia, and Depression in a Post-Ovariectomy Patient Receiving Hormone Replacement Therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410721
"AbstractINTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are common musculoskeletal conditions in the maxillofacial area. Although strong relationships between TMDs and other pain and diseases exist, few studies have comprehensively assessed the association between chronic diseases, ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders and TMD.METHODS: Of 25,534 individuals included in the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2012), 17,575 aged ≥20 years who completed survey items on TMD symptoms were included for cross-sectional analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between chronic diseases, ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders and examination findings, and TMD symptoms after adjusting for various confounding variables.RESULTS: Out of 17,575 participants, 2,059 (11.75%) reported experience of ≥1 TMD symptom(s). Compared to individuals without chronic disease, those with asthma (odds ratio (OR) 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.96), migraine (1.44; 1.26-1.65), osteoarthritis (1.51; 1.20-1.89), thyroid dysfunction (1.49; 1.13-1.96), and depressive symptoms (1.51; 1.29-1.77) had higher ORs for TMD prevalence. Participants with tinnitus (1.97; 1.70-2.27), hearing difficulties (1.55; 1.29-1.87), dizziness (1.52; 1.27-1.82), rhinitis (1.46; 1.28-1.65), and xerophthalmia (1.82; 1.57-2.12) also displayed higher ORs for TMD prevalence. Patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis upon otolaryngologic examination exhibited an OR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.11-1.87) for TMD prevalence, while that for individuals with abnormal laryngoscopic results was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36-0.90).CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply that TMDs, chronic diseases, and ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders hold various correlations, suggesting the need for multitarget approaches to effectively address this phenomenon.","Song HS, Shin JS, Lee J, Lee YJ, Kim MR, Cho JH, Kim KW, Park Y, Song HJ, Park SY, Kim S, Kim M, Ha IH",PLoS One. 2018 Jan 31;13(1):e0191336. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191336. eCollection  2018.,"Association between temporomandibular disorders, chronic diseases, and ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders in Korean adults: A cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385182
"AbstractChronic migraine is one of neurological disorders with high rate of disability, but sufficient attention has not been paid in this field. A large number of clinical studies have shown traditional Chinese acupuncture is a kind of effective treatment with less side effects. Through the analysis of literature regarding acupuncture and migraine published from 1981 to 2017 in CNKI and PubMed databases, the mechanism of neural plasticity of acupuncture on chronic migraine was explored. It was believed the progress of chronic migraine involved the changes of neural plasticity in neural structure and function, and the neural plasticity related with neural sensitization during the process of chronic migraine was discussed from three aspects of electrophysiology, molecular chemistry and radiography. Acupuncture could treat and prevent chronic migraine via the mechanism of neural plasticity, but there was no related literature, hindering the further spreading and development of acupuncture for chronic migraine.","Xu X, Liu L, Zhao L, Qu Z, Zhu Y, Zhang Y, Wang L",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2017 Oct 12;37(10):1134-40. doi: 10.13703/j.0255-2930.2017.10.029.,[Mechanism of neural plasticity of acupuncture on chronic migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354986

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To explore the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture(EA)by modulating 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 (5-HT7) receptor in periaqueductal gray (PAG) and plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).METHODS: Forty-two male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control，model and EA groups, 14 rat in each one. The neurogenic migraine model was established by repeated electrical stimulation on sagittal sinus duramater. Intracranial electrodes were used in the control group without stimuli. The rats in the EA group received EA (0.5－1 mA, 2 Hz/15 Hz) at ""Fengchi"" (GB 20) for 10 min after dural electrical stimulation, once a day for 6 days. The expression of 5-HT7 receptor in the PAG was assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively; plasma CGRP was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the positive neuron number and protein expression of 5-HT7 receptor in PAG and plasma CGRP increased after model establishment (all P<0.001). The above mentioned indexes were reversed in the EA group compared with those in the model group (the positive neuron number and protein expression of 5-HT7 receptor, P<0.01; plasma CGRP, P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: EA at GB 20 can down-regulate the expression of 5-HT7 receptor in the PAG and reduce the content of plasma CGRP in the rats of migraine.","Pei P, Chen HZ, Wang YX, Yang WM, Liu L, Wang LP",Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2017 Dec 25;42(6):510-3. doi: 10.13702/j.1000-0607.2017.06.008.,[Effect of Electroacupuncture on Expression of 5-HT7 Receptor in Periaqueductal Gray and Plasma Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide in Migraine Rats].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29318857
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of balance acupuncture for migraine without aura.METHODS: Blind evaluation was conducted. Forty patients with migraine without aura were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 19 cases in each one with 1 patient dropped out respectively. In the observation group, Toutongxue, the middle point was used in the hollow before the 1, 2 metatarsal combination, and in the control group, a sham point was applied in the hollow before the 3, 4 metatarsal combination. The manipulation in the two groups was the same. The treatment was given for 4 weeks, once a day, 5 times a week. The comprehensive score and visual analogue scale (VAS) were used before and after treatment, as well as 4 weeks after treatment.RESULTS: The comprehensive score and VAS score after treatment in the observation group decreased after treatment (both P<0.05), of which the total headache time and attack number for one month were lower than those before treatment (both P<0.05), but at follow-up the VAS score was higher than that after treatment (P<0.05). The above indices in the control group were not significantly different from those before treatment (allP>0.05). All the indices in the observation group after treatment and at follow-up were lower than those in the control group (all P<0.05).

"AbstractDaith piercing is an ear piercing located at the crus of the helix, bilaterally. It is getting great consent on social media as alternative treatment in chronic migraine. No data about its efficacy and action are available in scientific literature so far. We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient suffering from refractory chronic migraine with medication-overuse, who substantially improved after bilateral ear daith piercing. His migraine was refractory to symptomatic as well as prophylactic therapies. He used to treat headaches with up to five symptomatic drugs per attack and had attempted several pharmacological preventive therapies, including Onabotulinumtoxin A. He also underwent detoxification treatments with intravenous steroids and diazepam, without durable benefit. At the time of daith piercing, the headache-related disability measures showed a HIT-6 score of 64, a MIDAS-score of 70, and a 11-point Box scale of 5. On his own free will, he decided to get a ""daith piercing."" After that, he experienced a reduction of migraine attacks, which became very rare, and infrequent, less disabling episodes of tension-type headache (HIT-6 score of 56; MIDAS score of 27, 11-point Box scale of 3). Painkiller assumption has much decreased: he takes only one tablet of indomethacin 50 mg to treat tensive headaches, about four times per month. Beyond a placebo effect, we can speculate a vagal modulation as the action mechanism of daith piercing: a nociceptive sensory stimulus applied to trigeminal and vagal areas of the ear can activate ear vagal afferents, which can modulate pain pathways by means of projections to the caudal trigeminal nucleus, to the locus coeruleus and to the nucleus raphe magnus. Currently, daith piercing cannot be recommended as migraine treatment because of the lack of scientific evidence, the unquantified rate of failure and the associated risks with insertion. However, given the increasing but anecdotal evidence, we think that the mechanism needs testing by means of a controlled clinical trial in a population of chronic migraineurs.","Cascio Rizzo A, Paolucci M, Altavilla R, Brunelli N, Assenza F, Altamura C, Vernieri F",Front Neurol. 2017 Nov 27;8:624. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2017.00624. eCollection  2017.,Daith Piercing in a Case of Chronic Migraine: A Possible Vagal Modulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230190
"AbstractDespite wide use in clinical practice, acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic pain. Our objective was to update an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We included randomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture control for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or shoulder pain. Trials were only included if allocation concealment was unambiguously determined to be adequate. Raw data were obtained from study authors and entered into an individual patient data meta-analysis. The main outcome measures were pain and function. An additional 13 trials were identified, with data received for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was superior to sham as well as no acupuncture control for each pain condition (all P < .001) with differences between groups close to .5 SDs compared with no acupuncture control and close to .2 SDs compared with sham. We also found clear evidence that the effects of acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in treatment effect at 1 year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious association between trial outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes of acupuncture were associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects sizes for sham controlled trials that used a penetrating needle for sham, and for trials that had high intensity of intervention in the control arm. We conclude that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, with treatment effects persisting over time. Although factors in addition to the specific effects of needling at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the treatment effect, decreases in pain after acupuncture cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Variations in the effect size of acupuncture in different trials are driven predominantly by differences in treatments received by the control group rather than by differences in the characteristics of acupuncture treatment.PERSPECTIVE: Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal, headache, and osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over time and cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects.

"AbstractStress is considered to be the most common factor reported to trigger headaches in children and adolescents. Although tension-type headache and migraine are the two most common types of headache in children and adolescents, they are often untreated, ignoring their stressful background. We provide a narrative review of the available evidence for health-care professionals involved in stress-related headache management and health promotion programs. An integrative plan is delivered through lifestyle improvement and biopsychosocial modifying stress response techniques. Healthy dietary choices, sleep hygiene, and regular exercise, although limited, are effective for young sufferers. Biopsychosocial therapies such as relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acupuncture focus at stress physiological and behavioral relief. Our purpose is to suggest a stress-related headache management to empower children to make healthy choices in order to improve their lifelong well-being and quality of life. We aim to authorize relationship between nurses and other health-care providers with background knowledge around stress management for pediatric headache populations.","Bougea A, Spantideas N, Chrousos GP",J Child Health Care. 2018 Mar;22(1):19-33. doi: 10.1177/1367493517738123.

"AbstractPatients with migraine are reportedly at increased risk of developing dementia. We aimed to investigate the association between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use and dementia risk in migraine patients. This longitudinal cohort study used the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 32,386 diagnosed migraine patients aged 20 years and above who received treatment from 1997 to 2010. To balance comparability between TCM users and non-TCM users, we randomly selected equal numbers from each group, and compared subgroups compiled based on combinations of age, sex, index year, and year of migraine diagnosis. All enrollees received follow-up until the end of 2013 to measure dementia incidence. We identified 1,402 TCM users and non-TCM users after frequency matching. A total of 134 subjects were newly diagnosed with dementia during the follow-up period. TCM users were significantly less likely to develop dementia than non-TCM users. The most frequently prescribed formulae and single Chinese herbal products were Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San and Yan-Hu-Suo, respectively. This population-based study revealed a decreased dementia risk in migraine patients with TCM use. These findings may provide a reference for dementia prevention strategies, and help integrate TCM into clinical intervention programs that provide a favorable prognosis for migraine patients.","Liu CT, Wu BY, Hung YC, Wang LY, Lee YY, Lin TK, Lin PY, Chen WF, Chiang JH, Hsu SF, Hu WL",Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 8;8(45):79680-79692. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.19094. eCollection  2017 Oct 3.,Decreased risk of dementia in migraine patients with traditional Chinese medicine use: a population-based cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108348
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Migraine is a common type of headache. Sometimes adequate pain relief is not achieved by conventional treatments. Acupuncture and botulinum toxin-A injection are known as non-pharmacological interventions for this purpose. The aim of this research was to compare the effect of acupuncture with botulinum toxin-A injection and pharmacological treatment in controlling chronic migraine.METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on patients with chronic migraine in the North of Iran during 2014-2015. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to groups receiving acupuncture (A) or botulinum toxin A (B) and controls (C) by designed quadripartite blocks. All patients were evaluated at baseline, one, two and three months after treatment using visual analogue scale (VAS) score and other parameters. The analysis of data was performed in SPSS software Version 19.RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients (48 males and 102 females) completed this study. During the 3- month study, the pain severity significantly diminished in three groups (P=0.0001), with greater reduction in group A (P=0.0001). The number of days per month with migraine, absence from work and the need for medication significantly decreased in three groups at 3 times of evaluation (p<0.05) with fewer side effects in group A (P=0.021).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture, botulinum toxin-A injection and pharmacological treatment have beneficial effects on chronic migraine; however, acupuncture showed more effectiveness and fewer complications.","Naderinabi B, Saberi A, Hashemi M, Haghighi M, Biazar G, Abolhasan Gharehdaghi F, Sedighinejad A, Chavoshi T",Caspian J Intern Med. 2017 Summer;8(3):196-204. doi: 10.22088/cjim.8.3.196.,Acupuncture and botulinum toxin A injection in the treatment of chronic migraine: A randomized controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932372
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess analgesia provided by acupuncture, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, to patients presenting to emergency departments with acute low back pain, migraine or ankle sprain.DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, assessor-blinded, equivalence and non-inferiority trial of analgesia, comparing acupuncture alone, acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy, and pharmacotherapy alone for alleviating pain in the emergency department. Setting, participants: Patients presenting to emergency departments in one of four tertiary hospitals in Melbourne with acute low back pain, migraine, or ankle sprain, and with a pain score on a 10-point verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) of at least 4.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was pain at one hour (T1). Clinically relevant pain relief was defined as achieving a VNRS score below 4, and statistically relevant pain relief as a reduction in VNRS score of greater than 2 units.RESULTS: 1964 patients were assessed between January 2010 and December 2011; 528 patients with acute low back pain (270 patients), migraine (92) or ankle sprain (166) were randomised to acupuncture alone (177 patients), acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy (178) or pharmacotherapy alone (173). Equivalence and non-inferiority of treatment groups was found overall and for the low back pain and ankle sprain groups in both intention-to-treat and per protocol (PP) analyses, except in the PP equivalence testing of the ankle sprain group. 15.6% of patients had clinically relevant pain relief and 36.9% had statistically relevant pain relief at T1; there were no between-group differences.CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of acupuncture in providing acute analgesia for patients with back pain and ankle sprain was comparable with that of pharmacotherapy. Acupuncture is a safe and acceptable form of analgesia, but none of the examined therapies provided optimal acute analgesia.

"AbstractIndividual differences of brain changes of neural communication and integration in the modular architecture of the human brain network exist for the repeated migraine attack and physical or psychological stressors. However, whether the interindividual variability in the migraine brain connectome predicts placebo response to placebo treatment is still unclear. Using DTI and graph theory approaches, we systematically investigated the topological organization of white matter networks in 71 patients with migraine without aura (MO) and 50 matched healthy controls at three levels: global network measure, nodal efficiency, and nodal intramodule/intermodule efficiency. All patients participated in an 8-week sham acupuncture treatment to induce analgesia. In our results, 30% (n = 21) of patients had 50% change in migraine days from baseline after placebo treatment. At baseline, abnormal increased network integration was found in MO patients as compared with the HC group, and the increased global efficiency before starting clinical treatment was associated with their following placebo response. For nodal efficiency, significantly increased within-subnetwork nodal efficiency and intersubnetwork connectivity of the hippocampus and middle frontal gyrus in patients' white matter network were correlated with the responses of follow-up placebo treatment. Our findings suggested that the trait-like individual differences in pain-related maladaptive stress interfered with and diminished the capacity of chronic pain modulation differently, and the placebo response for treatment could be predicted from a prior white matter network modular structure in migraineurs.

				English, RussianЦель исследования. Оценка влияния различных методов рефлексотерапии (РТ) на основные клинические показатели пациентов с хронической мигренью, количество используемых анальгетиков, динамику коморбидных хронической мигрени расстройств. Материал и методы. В исследование были включены 84 пациента, 60 (71,5%) женщин и 24 (28,5%) мужчины, в возрасте от 18 до 63 лет с диагнозом 'хроническая мигрень'. Осуществлялась рандомизация пациентов на четыре группы: в группе су-джок было 22 пациента, в группе иглорефлексотерапии (ИРТ) - 22, в группе электроакупунктуры (ЭАП) - 20 и в группе контроля - 20. Во всех группах назначался топирамат в средней дозе 100 мг/сут. Состояние пациентов оценивали до лечения, через 4 и 16 нед от его начала. Результаты. В основных группах был отмечен достоверно больший регресс частоты головной боли (ГБ) по сравнению с контролем: в группе су-джок было 19±1,12 дня с ГБ в месяц до лечения и 6,57±1,3 дня после, в группе ИРТ - 21,6±1,68 и 7±1,78 соответственно, в группе ЭАП - 20,25±1,97 и 5,75±0,63 соответственно. Наряду с этим каждый из методов РТ оказал влияние на различные клинические аспекты течения хронической мигрени и коморбидные расстройства: метод су-джок был наиболее эффективен в коррекции вегетативных расстройств, применение ИР приводило к статистически значимому снижению интенсивности ГБ и регрессу тревожных расстройств. В группе ЭАП отмечалось достоверное повышение болевого порога и наименьшее число дней с ГБ в месяц. Заключение. РТ является методом выбора в составе комплексного лечения пациентов с хронической мигренью. Для успешного лечения и последующей реабилитации пациентов с хронической мигренью необходим индивидуально ориентированный подход к назначению различных рефлексотерапевтических методов.AIM: To evaluate the effect of different reflexology techniques on main clinical indices of patients with chronic migraine, the number of analgesics used and dynamics of chronic migraine comorbid disorders.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 84 patients (60 women (71.5%) and 24 men (28.5%)), aged from 18 to 63 years, with a diagnosis of chronic migraine. Patients were randomized in 4 groups - Su Jok (n=22), acupuncture (n=22), electroacupuncture (n=20), control (n=20). Topiramate was administered in all groups in dose of 100 mg daily. Patients were evaluated before treatment, after 4 and 16 weeks from randomization.RESULTS: There was a marked regression in frequency of headache in reflexological groups in comparison with the control. The number of days with headache was 19±1.12 at baseline and 6.57±1.3 days after treatment in the Su Jok group; 21.6±1.688 and 7±1.786 days in the acupuncture group; 20.25±1.97 and 5.75±0.633 days in the electroacupuncture group. Each of the methods had an impact on various clinical aspects of chronic migraine and comorbid disorders: Su Jok was most effective in treatment of autonomic disorders, the use of acupuncture resulted in the significant reduction of headache intensity and regression of anxiety disorders. The electroacupuncture group showed a significant increase in pain threshold and the least number of days with headache per month.CONCLUSION: Reflexotherapy is a method of choice in the complex treatment of patients with chronic migraine. Taking into account complex diagnosis, the individually oriented approach in prescribing of different reflexology techniques for successful treatment and subsequent rehabilitation of patients with chronic migraine is required.","Safonov MI, Naprienko MV",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 2017;117(5):22-25. doi: 10.17116/jnevro20171175122-25.,[Analysis of the efficacy of reflexology in the complex treatment of chronic migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28638026
"AbstractMost migraine patients suffer from cutaneous allodynia; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine, and it is therefore, a potential therapeutic target for treating the pain. In the present study, a rat model of conscious migraine, induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus, was established and treated with electroacupuncture at Fengchi (GB20) (depth of 2-3 mm, frequency of 2/15 Hz, intensity of 0.5-1.0 mA, 15 minutes/day, for 7 consecutive days). Electroacupuncture at GB20 significantly alleviated the decrease in hind paw and facial withdrawal thresholds and significantly lessened the increase in the levels of CGRP in the trigeminal ganglion, trigeminal nucleus caudalis and ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus in rats with migraine. No CGRP-positive cells were detected in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis or ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus by immunofluorescence. Our findings suggest that electroacupuncture treatment ameliorates migraine pain and associated cutaneous allodynia by modulating the trigeminovascular system ascending pathway, at least in part by inhibiting CGRP expression in the trigeminal ganglion.","Zhao LP, Liu L, Pei P, Qu ZY, Zhu YP, Wang LP",Neural Regen Res. 2017 May;12(5):804-811. doi: 10.4103/1673-5374.206652.,Electroacupuncture at Fengchi (GB20) inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide expression in the trigeminovascular system of a rat model of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616038
"AbstractNeuroimaging studies described brain structural changes that comprise the mechanisms underlying individual differences in migraine development and maintenance. However, whether such interindividual variability in migraine was observed in a pretreatment scan is a predisposition for subsequent hypoalgesia to placebo treatment that remains largely unclear. Using T1-weighted imaging, we investigated this issue in 50 healthy controls (HC) and 196 patients with migraine without aura (MO). An 8-week double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled acupuncture was used, and we only focused on the data from the sham acupuncture group. Eighty patients participated in an 8-weeks sham acupuncture treatment, and were subdivided (50% change in migraine days from baseline) into recovering (MOr) and persisting (MOp) patients. Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis were performed to evaluate brain structural and functional changes. At baseline, MOp and MOr had similar migraine activity, anxiety and depression; reduced migraine days were accompanied by decreased anxiety in MOr. In our findings, the MOr group showed a smaller volume in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and decreased mPFC-related functional connectivity was found in the default mode network. Additionally, the reduction in migraine days after placebo treatment was significantly associated with the baseline gray matter volume of the mPFC which could also predict post-treatment groups with high accuracy. It indicated that individual differences for the brain structure in the pain modulatory system at baseline served as a substrate on how an individual facilitated or diminished hypoalgesia responses to placebo treatment in migraineurs.

"AbstractMigraine is a common neurological disease with a high prevalence and unsatisfactory treatment options. The specific pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine remain unclear, which restricts the development of effective treatments for this prevalent disorder. The aims of this study were to 1) compare the spontaneous brain activity differences between Migraine without Aura (MwoA) patients and healthy controls (HCs), using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) calculation method, and 2) explore how an effective treatment (verum acupuncture) could modulate the ALFF of MwoA patients. One hundred MwoA patients and forty-six matched HCs were recruited. Patients were randomized to four weeks' verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Patients had resting state BOLD-fMRI scan before and after treatment, while HCs only had resting state BOLD-fMRI scan at baseline. Headache intensity, headache frequency, self-rating anxiety and self-rating depression were used for clinical efficacy evaluation. Compared with HCs, MwoA patients showed increased ALFF in posterior insula and putamen/caudate, and reduced ALFF in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM)/trigeminocervical complex (TCC). After longitudinal verum acupuncture treatment, the decreased ALFF of the RVM/TCC was normalized in migraine patients. Verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture have different modulation effects on ALFF of RVM/TCC in migraine patients. Our results suggest that impairment of the homeostasis of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway is involved in the neural pathophysiology of migraines. Effective treatments, such as verum acupuncture, could help to restore this imbalance.","Li Z, Zeng F, Yin T, Lan L, Makris N, Jorgenson K, Guo T, Wu F, Gao Y, Dong M, Liu M, Yang J, Li Y, Gong Q, Liang F, Kong J",Neuroimage Clin. 2017 May 22;15:367-375. doi: 10.1016/j.nicl.2017.05.013. eCollection  2017.,Acupuncture modulates the abnormal brainstem activity in migraine without aura patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580293
"AbstractHeadaches, including primary headaches such as migraine and tension-type headache, are a common clinical problem. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM), formerly known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), uses evidence informed modalities to assist in the health and healing of patients. CIM commonly includes the use of nutrition, movement practices, manual therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and mind-body strategies. This review summarizes the literature on the use of CIM for primary headache and is based on five meta-analyses, seven systematic reviews, and 34 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The overall quality of the evidence for CIM in headache management is generally low and occasionally moderate. Available evidence suggests that traditional Chinese medicine including acupuncture, massage, yoga, biofeedback, and meditation have a positive effect on migraine and tension headaches. Spinal manipulation, chiropractic care, some supplements and botanicals, diet alteration, and hydrotherapy may also be beneficial in migraine headache. CIM has not been studied or it is not effective for cluster headache. Further research is needed to determine the most effective role for CIM in patients with headache.","Millstine D, Chen CY, Bauer B",BMJ. 2017 May 16;357:j1805. doi: 10.1136/bmj.j1805.,Complementary and integrative medicine in the management of headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512119

"AbstractMigraine auras are typically visual in nature but can manifest as disturbances in somatosensory, auditory, and olfactory senses. Reports of multiple sensory auras are rare in the literature, but their existence may offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of this highly common yet complex neurological condition. Here we report a case of multiple sensory auras involving somatosensory, auditory, and olfactory disturbances in a patient with migraine without visual manifestations. A 45-year-old woman with a 20-year history of migrainous headaches presented with complaints of rightsided facial and hand numbness and paraesthesia. In addition to somatosensory symptoms, she eventually presented with tinnitus, cutaneous allodynia, and phantosmia, each of which was temporally associated with episodes of headache. No abnormalities were detected on NCS, EEG, MRI, and laboratory investigations. Her symptoms were managed by prophylactic medications and acupuncture. The theories of cortical spreading depression, cortical sensitization, and thalamocortical network involvement were discussed as possible explanations for sensory auras in migraine. This case report of migraine with multiple sensory auras spanning somatosensory, auditory, and olfactory modalities offers novel insights into the pathophysiology of migrainous auras.","Oey NE, Lo YL",Acta Neurol Taiwan. 2016 Dec 15;25(4):148-151.,Migraine with Multiple Sensory Auras.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382614

"AbstractImportance: The long-term prophylactic effects of acupuncture for migraine are uncertain.Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of true acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture and being placed in a waiting-list control group for migraine prophylaxis.Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a 24-week randomized clinical trial (4 weeks of treatment followed by 20 weeks of follow-up). Participants were randomly assigned to true acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or a waiting-list control group. The trial was conducted from October 2012 to September 2014 in outpatient settings at 3 clinical sites in China. A total of 249 participants 18 to 65 years old with migraine without aura based on the criteria of the International Headache Society, with migraine occurring 2 to 8 times per month.Interventions: Participants in the true acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups received treatment 5 days per week for 4 weeks for a total of 20 sessions. Participants in the waiting-list group did not receive acupuncture but were informed that 20 sessions of acupuncture would be provided free of charge at the end of the trial.Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants used diaries to record migraine attacks. The primary outcome was the change in the frequency of migraine attacks from baseline to week 16. Secondary outcome measures included the migraine days, average headache severity, and medication intake every 4 weeks within 24 weeks.Results: A total of 249 participants 18 to 65 years old were enrolled, and 245 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. One hundred eighty-nine (77.1%) were women. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 3 groups. The mean (SD) change in frequency of migraine attacks differed significantly among the 3 groups at 16 weeks after randomization (P < .001); the mean (SD) frequency of attacks decreased in the true acupuncture group by 3.2 (2.1), in the sham acupuncture group by 2.1 (2.5), and the waiting-list group by 1.4 (2.5); a greater reduction was observed in the true acupuncture than in the sham acupuncture group (difference of 1.1 attacks; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P = .002) and in the true acupuncture vs waiting-list group (difference of 1.8 attacks; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; P < .001). Sham acupuncture was not statistically different from the waiting-list group (difference of 0.7 attacks; 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.4; P = .07).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with migraine without aura, true acupuncture may be associated with long-term reduction in migraine recurrence compared with sham acupuncture or assigned to a waiting list.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01687660.","Zhao L, Chen J, Li Y, Sun X, Chang X, Zheng H, Gong B, Huang Y, Yang M, Wu X, Li X, Liang F",JAMA Intern Med. 2017 Apr 1;177(4):508-515. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.9378.,The Long-term Effect of Acupuncture for Migraine Prophylaxis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241154
"ExcerptBACKGROUND: There has been an increase in the utilisation of acupuncture in recent years, yet the evidence base is insufficiently well established to be certain about its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Addressing the questions related to the evidence base will reduce uncertainty and help policy- and decision-makers with regard to whether or not wider access is appropriate and provides value for money.AIM: Our aim was to establish the most reliable evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic pain by drawing on relevant evidence, including recent high-quality trials, and to develop fresh evidence on acupuncture for depression. To extend the evidence base we synthesised the results of published trials using robust systematic review methodology and conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture for depression.METHODS AND RESULTS: We synthesised the evidence from high-quality trials of acupuncture for chronic pain, consisting of musculoskeletal pain related to the neck and low back, osteoarthritis of the knee, and headache and migraine, involving nearly 18,000 patients. In an individual patient data (IPD) pairwise meta-analysis, acupuncture was significantly better than both sham acupuncture (p < 0.001) and usual care (p < 0.001) for all conditions. Using network meta-analyses, we compared acupuncture with other physical therapies for osteoarthritis of the knee. In both an analysis of all available evidence and an analysis of a subset of better-quality trials, using aggregate-level data, we found acupuncture to be one of the more effective therapies. We developed new Bayesian methods for analysing multiple individual patient-level data sets to evaluate heterogeneous continuous outcomes. An accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis found transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to be cost-effective for osteoarthritis at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year when all trials were synthesised. When the analysis was restricted to trials of higher quality with adequate allocation concealment, acupuncture was cost-effective. In a RCT of acupuncture or counselling compared with usual care for depression, in which half the patients were also experiencing comorbid pain, we found acupuncture and counselling to be clinically effective and acupuncture to be cost-effective. For patients in whom acupuncture is inappropriate or unavailable, counselling is cost-effective.CONCLUSION: We have provided the most robust evidence from high-quality trials on acupuncture for chronic pain. The synthesis of high-quality IPD found that acupuncture was more effective than both usual care and sham acupuncture. Acupuncture is one of the more clinically effective physical therapies for osteoarthritis and is also cost-effective if only high-quality trials are analysed. When all trials are analysed, TENS is cost-effective. Promising clinical and economic evidence on acupuncture for depression needs to be extended to other contexts and settings. For the conditions we have investigated, the drawing together of evidence on acupuncture from this programme of research has substantially reduced levels of uncertainty. We have identified directions for further research. Our research also provides a valuable basis for considering the potential role of acupuncture as a referral option in health care and enabling providers and policy-makers to make decisions based on robust sources of evidence.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN63787732.FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.Copyright © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2017.

"AbstractAIM: The purpose of this retrospective multicenter study was to evaluate the use and the self-perceived efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with primary headaches.METHODS: Study of a cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with primary headache, consecutively referred to 13 juvenile Italian Headache Centers. An ad hoc questionnaire was used for clinical data collection.RESULTS: Among 706 patients with primary headaches included in the study, 637 cases with a single type of headache (migraine 76% - with and without aura in 10% and 67% respectively; tension-type headache 24%) were selected (mean age at clinical interview: 12 years). Acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (in particular ibuprofen) were commonly used to treat attacks, by 76% and 46% of cases respectively. Triptans were used overall by 6% of migraineurs and by 13% of adolescents with migraine, with better efficacy than acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Preventive drugs were used by 19% of migraineurs and by 3% of subjects with tension-type headache. In migraineurs, flunarizine was the most frequently used drug (18%), followed by antiepileptic drugs (7%) and pizotifen (6%), while cyproheptadine, propanolol and amitriptyline were rarely used. Pizotifen showed the best perceived efficacy and tolerability. Melatonin and nutraceuticals were used by 10% and 32% of subjects, respectively, both for migraine and tension-type headache, with good results in terms of perceived efficacy and tolerability. Non-pharmacological preventive treatments (i.e. relaxation techniques, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acupuncture) were used only by 10% of cases (migraine 9%, tension-type headache 15%).DISCUSSION: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially ibuprofen, should be preferred to acetaminophen for acute attacks of migraine or tension-type headache, because they were usually more effective and well tolerated. Triptans could be used more frequently as first or almost second choice for treating migraine attack in adolescents. Non-pharmacological preventive treatments are recommended by some pediatric guidelines as first-line interventions for primary headaches and their use should be implemented in clinical practice. Prospective multicenter studies based on larger series are warranted to better understand the best treatment strategies for young people with primary headaches.Copyright © 2016 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

"AbstractBackground. While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment in migraine has been found to attenuate pain and frequencies of attacks, the underlying mechanism of its antinociceptive effect remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the serotonin system may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. Method. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to Control, Model, EA, and sham acupuncture (SA) groups. HomeCageScan was used to measure the effects on spontaneous nociceptive behaviors. Radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to evaluate the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) in the plasma and three-key structure of the descending pain modulatory system. Results. Our study showed that EA pretreatment could produce a significant reduction in resting, freezing, and grooming behavior and a significant increase in exploration behavior. Furthermore, we found that the level of 5-HT in plasma was significantly increased, and it was significantly decreased in the descending pain modulatory system in Model group. The aforementioned results were significantly reversed in EA group; that is, the level of 5-HT was increased in the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) region and decreased in the plasma. Conclusion. EA pretreatment exerts antinociceptive effects in a rat model of recurrent migraine, possibly via modulation of the serotonin system.","Liu L, Pei P, Zhao LP, Qu ZY, Zhu YP, Wang LP",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2016;2016:1846296.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: The anti-nociceptive effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in migraine have been documented in multiple randomised controlled trials. Neurogenic inflammation plays a key role in migraine attacks, and the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have been associated with the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CB1 receptors mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of EA on migraine attacks.METHODS: A migraine model was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (TGES). Rats received EA daily on the 5 days preceding TGES with (TGES+EA+SR141716 group) or without (TGES+EA group) intraperitoneal injections of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716. Another group of TGES rats (TGES+MA group) and a non-TGES sham-operated group of rats (Sham+MA group) received minimal acupuncture (MA). Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations were determined in serum obtained from the ipsilateral jugular vein at initiation of TGES and 5 min after. Postmortem interleukin (IL)-1β and cyclooxygenase (COX)2 protein levels in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and plasma protein extravasation (PPE) in the dura mater were assessed.RESULTS: TGES induced increases in serum CGRP and PGE2 levels (TGES+MA vs baseline and vs Sham: all p<0.001), as well as IL-1β and COX2 protein expression in the TG, and neurogenic PPE levels (TGES+MA vs Sham+MA: all p<0.001). EA attenuated TGES-induced increases in the levels of these proteins (TGES+EA vs TGES+MA: all p<0.001). CB1 receptor antagonism reversed the effects of EA (TGES+EA+SR141716 vs TGES+EA: all p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: CB1 receptors appear to mediate anti-inflammatory effects of EA in a rat model of migraine.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"AbstractThere is uncertainty regarding how long the effects of acupuncture treatment persist after a course of treatment. We aimed to determine the trajectory of pain scores over time after acupuncture, using a large individual patient data set from high-quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic pain. The available individual patient data set included 29 trials and 17,922 patients. The chronic pain conditions included musculoskeletal pain (low back, neck, and shoulder), osteoarthritis of the knee, and headache/migraine. We used meta-analytic techniques to determine the trajectory of posttreatment pain scores. Data on longer term follow-up were available for 20 trials, including 6376 patients. In trials comparing acupuncture to no acupuncture control (wait-list, usual care, etc), effect sizes diminished by a nonsignificant 0.011 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: -0.014 to 0.037, P = 0.4) after treatment ended. The central estimate suggests that approximately 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be sustained at 12 months. For trials comparing acupuncture to sham, we observed a reduction in effect size of 0.025 SD per 3 months (95% confidence interval: 0.000-0.050, P = 0.050), suggesting approximately a 50% diminution at 12 months. The effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patients with chronic pain do not seem to decrease importantly over 12 months. Patients can generally be reassured that treatment effects persist. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture should take our findings into account when considering the time horizon of acupuncture effects. Further research should measure longer term outcomes of acupuncture.","MacPherson H, Vertosick EA, Foster NE, Lewith G, Linde K, Sherman KJ, Witt CM, Vickers AJ",Pain. 2017 May;158(5):784-793. doi: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000747.,The persistence of the effects of acupuncture after a course of treatment: a meta-analysis of patients with chronic pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27764035

"AbstractDear Editor, the practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine described psoriasis some 2000 years ago (1). Psoriasis vulgaris is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease whose worldwide prevalence ranges from 0.1-3% (2,3). Understanding the role of the immune system in psoriasis and the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune system has helped to manage this complex disease, which affects patients far beyond the skin changes themselves (2). In addition to the usual and widely accepted methods of treatment of psoriasis, including topical therapies, phototherapy, and conventional and biological systemic therapies, data can be found in the literature that suggest a favorable effect of acupuncture on the course of psoriasis (4,5). Despite that, this complementary method of traditional treatment of various diseases is not yet widely accepted worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), acupuncture has been an officially recognized method of treatment for more than 50 diseases from 1979 (5). At the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital Center Zagreb, acupuncture has been used since 2011 for the treatment of various types of headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and spinal pain syndromes. We report the case of a patient with a known history of psoriasis who was treated for chronic migraines with acupuncture. The 49-year-old female patient was examined for headache of a pulsating character that she had had for 16 years. The headache was mainly located on the left side of head and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and both photophobia and phonophobia, and there was a worsening of symptoms upon exertion. The headaches were occurring once a week with an average duration of 2-3 continuous days. The patient also had frequent mild headaches. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with psoriasis at the age of 29 and was occasionally treated with phototherapy. Systemic therapy for psoriasis had not been given to the patient thus far. After the clinical evaluation and considering the medical history and clinical findings, the diagnosis of chronic migraine was established and prophylactic therapy with dual antidepressant was introduced. On follow-up examinations, a reduction in the frequency and intensity of migraine headaches was observed. After one year there was a progression of symptoms, and treatments with acupuncture were started. Stainless steel filiform needles of 25 mm in length were inserted perpendicularly into points on the head, arm, and legs and retained for 30 minutes. The treatment was administered once a day for 10 days with an interval of 2-3 days between treatments. The patient showed significant improvement for a period of 6 months after the acupuncture treatment, which is why the treatment with acupuncture was repeated. The patient stated that very soon after the beginning of each acupuncture treatment, she had noticed a significant improvement regarding psoriatic lesions as a ""side effect"". On the first day of acupuncture, extensive erythematosquamous plaques were noticed on the skin of the dorsum of the feet (Figure 1), palms, and elbows. It is important to emphasize that the patient did not use any specific topical antipsoriatic therapies during the acupuncture treatment, but only bland emollients. During the third week of treatment, a significant improvement was observed, or according to the patient, ""she has not had such a good skin for a long time"" (Figure 2). The improvement of the clinical status can be explained by overlapping acupuncture points used in the treatment of pain syndromes and psoriasis or to the holistic effect of acupuncture. In recent years, several high-quality evidence-based Western medicine guidelines have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis (6,7). In addition to that modern approach, several studies confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of psoriasis. The recent review by Coyle et al. (4) indicates promising evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture for psoriasis treatment with an increasing number of people achieving clinical and statistical improvements. Furthermore, Wang et al. (8) have recently published the protocol for a systematic review which aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for patients with psoriasis. In acupuncture, hair-thin needles are inserted into the skin, releasing natural pain killers such as adenosine, endorphins, and serotonin into the body. It is known that patients with psoriatic arthritis can benefit from the treatment. Some patients may be concerned that acupuncture needles could worsen a skin flare-up but an acupuncturist uses sterile needles to prevent any risk to flaring skin. The advantage of acupuncture is that it is a very safe alternative medicine treatment and is not likely to interfere with any existing psoriasis treatment. It is important to note that acupuncture is a 5000-year-old alternative medicine treatment and that it has been officially recognized by the WHO for more than three decades (5). After achieving clinical improvement and regression of psoriatic plaques during the acupuncture for headache, the authors reviewed the literature and found reports about possible benefits of treating psoriasis with acupuncture. Therefore, the purpose of this letter and case study is to raise awareness and inform dermatologists about the different and until now under-explored possibilities of acupuncture in treating psoriasis.","Mahović D, Mrsić F",Acta Dermatovenerol Croat. 2016 Aug;24(3):221-2.,Acupuncture as a Complementary Method of Traditional Psoriasis Treatment: Myth or Reality?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663925
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to assess whether Zhengtian Capsule was non-inferior to flunarizine in efficacy and safety profile for prevention of migraine in adults.METHODS: This was a double-dummy, double-blind, multicenter, positive drug (flunarizine), parallel randomized controlled, non-inferior clinical trial. Patients (n = 360) were randomized in a 1:1 to receive either Zhengtian Capsule or flunarizine, including 12 weeks' intervention and 4 weeks' follow-up. The primary outcome measure was responder rate (defined as the percentage of subjects in a treatment group with 50 % or greater reduction in attack frequency during treatment compared with the baseline period). The secondary outcome measures included migraine attack frequency, the number of migraine days, pain evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) score, duration of migraine attacks, the times of using analgesics, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of migraine and the scores of short-form 36 Health Survey Scale (SF-36). Weight variation in both groups was also evaluated. Adverse events were monitored throughout the trial.RESULTS: Zhengtian Capsule was non-inferior to flunarizine in responder rate at week 12 and follow-up period (P = 0.002, P < 0.001). There was fewer migraine days in Zhengtian Capsule group at follow-up period compared with flunarizine (P = 0.001). For the total duration of migraine attacks, there was significant group difference at week 4 which favored the control group (P = 0.009). For the total score of PRO scale, there was statistical difference between the two groups at follow-up period (P = 0.021). There were also group differences between the two groups in the dimensions of somatization symptoms at week 4 (P = 0.022) and functional status at week 12 and follow-up period (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in migraine attack frequency, VAS scores reduction, consumption of acute pain drugs and the dimension scores of SF-36 at any time interval of the treatment period (P > 0.05). No severe adverse events occurred in the trial. Flunarizine was found associated with a weight gain.CONCLUSION: Zhengtian Capsule was non-inferior to flunarizine with regard to the primary endpoint. In addition, it could reduce migraine days and improve the functional status and somatization symptoms of migraine patients with good safety profile.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR), ChiCTR-TRC-13004412.","Cao K, Han F, Lin A, Yang W, Zhao J, Zhang H, Ding Y, Xie W, Xu Y, Yu T, Wang X, Yang X, Zhou J, Hou Q, Yu L, Gao Y",BMC Complement Altern Med. 2016 Sep 13;16:356. doi: 10.1186/s12906-016-1321-8.,"Zhengtian Capsule versus flunarizine in patients with migraine: a multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled, non-inferior clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27618916
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To assess the attitudes of physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and midwives toward complementary medicine (CM) at a Swiss academic hospital and toward its use for treating chronic pain.DESIGN: The cross-sectional survey took place from October to December 2013.SETTING: An e-mail sent to 4925 healthcare professionals (1969 physicians, 2372 nurses, 145 physical therapists, and 111 midwives) working at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, invited them to answer a web-based questionnaire.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 1247 healthcare professionals (response rate: 25.3%). Of these, 96.1% strongly agreed or agreed that CM could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain, with more nurses (96.7%) and midwives (100%) than physicians (93.8%) agreeing that CM could be useful (P < .001 for both comparisons). Women had more positive attitude toward CM than men (97.8% versus 91.2%; P < .001). Of the respondents, 96.9% were strongly in favor or in favor of offering CM, especially hypnosis (89.8%), osteopathy (85.5%), and acupuncture (83.4%), at the hospital for treating chronic pain. Respondents listed migraine (74.7%), tension headaches (70.6%), and low back pain (70.1%) as three main conditions for which they would refer patients for acupuncture. The three therapies with which respondents were the most unfamiliar were neuraltherapy (57.2%), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) (54.1%), and biofeedback (51.9%). Over half of respondents, 58.3%, had never referred a patient to a CM practitioner. A total of 84.3% of the respondents felt that they lacked the knowledge to inform their patients about CM.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence that evaluates the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment or prevention of migraine, tension-type headache, and chronic headache disorders.METHODS: Findings from selected systematic reviews and meta-analyses are summarized.RESULTS: Recently published systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that acupuncture is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to routine care only, medical management, and sham acupuncture 2 months after randomization. The evidence in support of acupuncture's comparative effectiveness at longer follow-up periods is mixed. Cost effectiveness analyses conducted in the United Kingdom and Germany suggest that acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment option in those countries. There are few or no cost-effectiveness studies of acupuncture in the United States.DISCUSSION: This brief review of the current, published evidence does not include a discussion of potential risks or adverse events associated with acupuncture. There is also the question of the extent to which placebo effects might contribute to acupuncture's clinical effectiveness. From a purely comparative effectiveness perspective, however, the evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses makes a compelling case in support of a potentially important role for acupuncture as part of a treatment plan for patients with migraine, tension-type headache, and several different types of chronic headache disorders.© 2016 American Headache Society.","Coeytaux RR, Befus D",Headache. 2016 Jul;56(7):1238-40. doi: 10.1111/head.12857.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy on migraine treated with acupoint implantation.METHODS: Sixty cases of migraine were randomized into a implantation group and an electroacupuncture (EA) group, 30 cases in each one. In the implantation group, implantation was used at Fengchi (GB 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Waiguan (TE 5), Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc., once every 2 weeks, for 4 weeks totally. In the EA group, the acupoints were the same as the implantation group, and EA was applied to Fengchi (GB 20) and Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Zusanli (ST 36), once every two days, for 4 weeks totally. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was adopted before and after treatment and the clinical efficacy was compared between the two groups.RESULTS: After treatment, VAS score was reduced in the implantation group and the EA group as compared with that before treatment (both P < 0.01). After treatment, VAS score in the implantation group was lower than that in the EA group (P < 0.01). The difference in VAS score before and after treatment in the implantation group was improved apparently as compared with that in the EA group (P < 0.01). The total effective rate in the implantation group was higher than that in the EA group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The acupoint implantation reduces VAS score in the patients of migraine and its clinical efficacy is better than that in the EA group.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane review from 2009.OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraine.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic migraine.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included five new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care), 15 a sham-acupuncture control group, and five a comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment. In comparisons with no-acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate. Comparison with no acupunctureAcupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I² = 57%; moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence). Comparison with sham acupunctureBoth after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.08; I² = 47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I² = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I² = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate quality evidence). The corresponding NNTBs are 11 (95% CI 7.00 to 20.00) and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00), respectively. The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups. Comparison with prophylactic drug treatmentAcupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I² being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches. Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham, but this effect is small. The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies, more than one year in duration, are lacking.","Linde K, Allais G, Brinkhaus B, Fei Y, Mehring M, Vertosick EA, Vickers A, White AR",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Jun 28;(6):CD001218. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD001218.pub3.,Acupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27351677

The evidence base for the effectiveness of acupuncture and its clinical applications is controversial, and although its efficacy and safety in the management of acute pain have been demonstrated, the quality of this modality is still questionable. The present study reports a case of acute ankle injury, which was treated with acupuncture. A 33-year-old man presented with acute twisted ankle injury. He had pain with swelling around the ankle, and he was experiencing difficulty in walking. His clinical diagnosis was acute ankle sprain with severe pain. Several drug treatments are used for pain control, but in this case, we used acupuncture. After treatment, his pain diminished significantly with a decrease in VAS pain level from 8 to 4 in 20 minutes. At follow-up after one month, we found no skin infection in this case.",Tantivesruangdet N,J Med Assoc Thai. 2016 Feb;99 Suppl 2:S223-6.,Acupuncture Treatment for Acute Ankle Injury in the Emergency Department: A Preliminary Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266242

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: Headache remains a frequent complaint for children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED). Typical treatments include oral or intravenous medications, but do not always relieve pain. An alternative intervention is auricular acupuncture. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of migraines in adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility and adverse effects of auricular acupuncture in the treatment of pediatric migraines in the ED.METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional, cohort study of patients 8 to 18 years of age. Efficacious ear points were located by needle contact or electrical point finder with attention to 2 migraine lines on the ear. ASP gold semipermanent ear needles were placed in the efficacious points and patients were monitored for 15 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in preintervention and postintervention pain scores using a numerical self-reported pain visual analog scale (VAS).RESULTS: Nineteen patients elected to enroll in the study. The mean change in the VAS scores was both clinically and statistically significant at 7.03 (interquartile range, 6-8.5) with a P value of less than 0.001. Two patients elected to withdraw from the study secondary to incomplete resolution of migraine pain despite improvement in VAS scores. There were no known adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: With all subjects showing improvement or resolution of migraine headache, this pilot study introduces an alternative intervention to pediatric migraine management. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of symptom resolution and comparative effectiveness; auricular acupuncture seems to be a valid alternative.","Graff DM, McDonald MJ",Pediatr Emerg Care. 2018 Apr;34(4):258-262. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000000789.,Auricular Acupuncture for the Treatment of Pediatric Migraines in the Emergency Department.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27139637
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the short-term effect on visual function of acupuncture treatment in a cohort of patients with inherited diseases of the retina.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective pilot study was performed on 14 patients (10 ♀, 4 ♂; mean age: 43.43 y (± 19.72 y)), with the clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed diagnosis of inherited disease of the retina. Acupuncture treatment consisted of needle application to the body and ears and was performed following a standardized protocol. The treatment was scheduled for 10 half-hour sessions over five weeks. Visual function was measured before acupuncture, between acupuncture treatments and after the end of treatment. Objective measurements included best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), contrast vision (CSV-1000, Vector Vision) and Goldmann perimetry (isopters 3IIIe; Haag-Streit). Subjective evaluation was based on evaluation questionnaires. To exclude the effect of variability on the psychophysical tests, a non-acupuncture control group (Nr: 8; 5 ♀, 3 ♂; mean age: 38.56 y (± 9.08 y)) was taken for comparison.RESULTS: All patients with inherited diseases of the retina showed general improvement in objective visual functions, with post-/pre- acupuncture improvement in: visual acuity (p = 0.031, left eyes), contrast vision (p = 0.015 and p = 0.041; both eyes) and widening of the temporal radius of the visual field (0.013; left eyes). Subjectively, all patients reported better daytime, color and contrast vision, better visual focus and less visual tiredness. In addition, some general symptoms, such as longer sleep-onset time, feeling cold, and migraine/headache attacks were significantly reduced.CONCLUSIONS: The acupuncture protocol improved visual function in our patients with inherited diseases of the retina and was well tolerated. Nevertheless, the long-term effect of this complementary therapy remains to be evaluated.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","Blechschmidt T, Krumsiek M, Todorova MG",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 2016 Apr;233(4):416-23. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-111819.

"AbstractAims This study aims to investigate the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) of the right frontoparietal network (rFPN) between migraineurs and healthy controls (HCs) in order to determine how the rFPN rs-fc can be modulated by effective treatment. Methods One hundred patients and 46 matched HCs were recruited. Migraineurs were randomized to verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after longitudinal treatments. Independent component analysis was applied in the data analysis. Results We found that migraineurs showed decreased rs-fc between the rFPN and bilateral precuneus compared with HCs. After treatments (real and sham), rFPN rs-fc with the precuneus was significantly reduced. This reduction was associated with headache intensity relief. In order to explore the role of the precuneus in acupuncture modulation, we performed a seed-based rs-fc analysis using the precuneus as a seed and found that the precuneus rs-fc with the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly enhanced after treatment. Conclusion Our results suggest that migraineurs are associated with abnormal rFPN rs-fc. An effective treatment, such as acupuncture, may relieve symptoms by strengthening the cognitive adaptation/coping process. Elucidation of the adaptation/coping mechanisms may open up a new window for migraine management.","Li Z, Lan L, Zeng F, Makris N, Hwang J, Guo T, Wu F, Gao Y, Dong M, Liu M, Yang J, Li Y, Gong Q, Sun S, Liang F, Kong J",Cephalalgia. 2017 Feb;37(2):161-176. doi: 10.1177/0333102416641665.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: There are five to nine million primary care office visits a year for migraine in the United States. However, migraine care is often suboptimal in the primary care setting. A prior study indicated that primary care physicians (PCPs) wanted direct contact with headache specialists to improve the migraine care they provide.OBJECTIVE: We sought to further examine PCPs' knowledge of migraine management and assess the feasibility of a multimodal migraine education program for PCPs.METHODS: We conducted a survey assessing PCPs' knowledge about migraine. We then held three live educational sessions and developed an email consultative service for PCPs to submit questions they had about migraine. We report both quantitative and qualitative findings.RESULTS: Twenty-one PCPs completed the survey. They were generally familiar with the epidemiology of migraine (mean prevalence of migraine reported was 12.6% ± 10.1), the psychiatric comorbidities (mean prevalence of comorbid depression was 24.5% ± 16.7, mean prevalence of comorbid anxiety was 24.6% ± 18.3), and evidence-based behavioral treatments. Fifty-six percent cited cognitive behavioral therapy, 78% cited biofeedback, and 61% cited relaxation therapy as evidence based treatments. Though most were aware of the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, they did not routinely assess for them (43% did not routinely assess for anxiety, 29% did not routinely assess for depression). PCPs reported frequently referring patients for non-level A evidence based treatments: special diets (60%), acupuncture (50%), physical therapy (30%), and psychoanalysis (20%). Relaxation therapy was a therapy recommended by 40% of the PCPs. Only 10% reported referring for cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback. Nineteen percent made minimal or no use of migraine preventive medications. Seventy-two percent were unaware of or only slightly aware of the American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine. There was variable attendance at the educational sessions (N=22 at 1st session, 6 at 2nd session, 15 at 3rd session). Very few PCPs used the email consultative service (N=4).CONCLUSIONS: Though PCPs are familiar with many aspects of migraine care, there is a need and opportunity for improvement. The three live sessions were poorly attended and the email consultative service was rarely used. We provide an in depth discussion of targeted areas for educational intervention, of the challenges in developing a migraine educational program for PCPs, and areas for future study.© 2016 American Headache Society.","Minen M, Shome A, Halpern A, Tishler L, Brennan KC, Loder E, Lipton R, Silbersweig D",Headache. 2016 Apr;56(4):725-40. doi: 10.1111/head.12803.

"AbstractINTRODUCTION: Migraine is a complex neurological disorder characterized by episodic, neurogenic, cerebrovascular inflammation and hypersensitization of brain tissues and the central nervous system, causing severe pain and debility. Research literature points mostly to pharmaceutical prophylactic and symptomatic treatments, nonpharmaceutical, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches, acupuncture, massage and bodywork studies, and none has been published on Bowenwork for migraine intervention. This prospective case report describes one migraineur's response to Bowenwork (a soft-tissue bodywork technique) with cessation of migraine, neck pain, and analgesic consumption, and improved well-being and activity function.METHODS: The client received 14 Bowenwork sessions over a four-month period using the self-reporting Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile version 2 (MYMOP2) to evaluate clinically meaningful changes. Baseline MYMOP2 data were recorded prior to the first and subsequent Bowenwork sessions to track changes in migraine and neck pain occurrences, other symptoms, medication use, functional ability and sense of well-being. Specific Bowenwork procedures were applied in each session to address various symptoms. The client did not receive other migraine treatment during this study.PARTICIPANT: A 66-year-old Caucasian female with a history of debilitating migraine since childhood, and severe neck pain and jaw injuries resulting from two motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) sustained as an adult. She had previously sought medical, pharmaceutical and CAM treatments for migraine, neck pain, and right-sided thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) symptoms, with no satisfactory relief.RESULTS: The client progressively reported decreased migraine and neck pain until acquiring a respiratory infection with prolonged coughing spells causing symptoms to recur (session 11). Prior to session 12, she experienced an allergic reaction to ingesting an unknown food allergen, requiring three days of prednisone and Benadryl treatment, exacerbating neck pain, but not migraine. At session 14, her MYMOP2 data showed no migraine, neck pain or medication use, improved activity function, and sense of well-being. Symptoms in her right arm and thumb persisted to a lesser extent.CONCLUSION: Bowenwork progressively offered migraine and neck pain relief for one chronic migraineur, with multiple somatic symptoms. Extenuating factors (jaw tension, TOS, respiratory infection, and allergic reaction) added complexity in monitoring progress and selecting appropriate Bowenwork procedures. Further research on Bowenwork's efficacy for migraine treatment on larger populations is needed.",Gustafson SL,Int J Ther Massage Bodywork. 2016 Mar 4;9(1):19-28. eCollection  2016 Mar.,Bowenwork for Migraine Relief: a Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26977217
"AbstractOur study aimed to identify patient-provider clusters with different patterns of expectations for treatment outcomes. All patients (n = 885) received acupuncture treatment from physicians for their migraine, headache, osteoarthritis, or chronic low back pain. We identified 6 robust patient-provider expectation clusters (PPECs; interclassification reliability >.89) showing differences between patients and providers in their expected treatment responses (eg, unrealistic optimists, optimistic doubters). For example, the optimistic doubters had high expectations for their treatment outcomes but were skeptical of the benefits of acupuncture in general. The providers expected good improvements for these patients. These 6 PPECs differed in their clinical characteristics and in the associated treatment responses. For example, unrealistic optimists showed the weakest treatment benefits after 6 months; other PPECs and clinical patterns are also presented in the report. Our study suggests that comparing the expectations of patients and providers is a valuable approach to identify groups of patients with greater responsiveness and those with limited treatment benefits.PERSPECTIVE: Patients and providers of acupuncture might vary in their expectation of the treatment effect and in clinical practice the overlap of expectations of patients and providers should be considered as important in initial consultations.Copyright © 2016 American Pain Society.

"AbstractFollowing evidence that acupuncture is clinically feasible and cost-effective in the treatment of headache, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends acupuncture as prophylactic treatment for migraine and tension headache. There has thus been expectation that other forms of headache should benefit also. Unfortunately, acupuncture has not generally been successful for cluster headache. This may be due to acupuncturists approaching the problem as one of severe migraine. In fact, cluster headache is classed as a trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. In this case report, episodic cluster headache is treated in the same way as has been shown effective for trigeminal neuralgia. Acupuncture is applied to the contralateral side at points appropriate for stimulating branches of the trigeminal nerve. Thus, ST2 is used for the infraorbital nerve, BL2 and Yuyao for the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves, and Taiyang for the temporal branch of the zygomatic nerve.",Hayhoe S,Acupunct Med. 2016 Feb;34(1):55-8. doi: 10.1136/acupmed-2015-211984rep.,Acupuncture for episodic cluster headache: a trigeminal approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26846705
"AbstractThe aims of this study were to 1) compare resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a key region in the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) between migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and healthy controls (HC), and 2) investigate how an effective treatment can influence the PAG rs-fc in MwoA patients. One hundred MwoA patients and forty-six matched HC were recruited. Patients were randomized to verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting state fMRI data were collected and seed based functional connectivity analysis was applied. Compared with HC, MwoA patients showed reduced rs-fc between the PAG and rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (rACC/mPFC), key regions in the DPMS and other pain related brain regions. The reduced rs-fc between the PAG and rACC/mPFC was associated with increased migraine headache intensity at the baseline. After treatments, rs-fc between the PAG and the rACC in MwoA patients significantly increased. The changes of rs-fc among the PAG, rACC and ventral striatum were significantly associated with headache intensity improvement. Impairment of the DPMS is involved in the neural pathophysiology of migraines. Impaired DPMS in migraine patients can be normalized after effective treatment.","Li Z, Liu M, Lan L, Zeng F, Makris N, Liang Y, Guo T, Wu F, Gao Y, Dong M, Yang J, Li Y, Gong Q, Liang F, Kong J",Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 3;6:20298. doi: 10.1038/srep20298.,Altered periaqueductal gray resting state functional connectivity in migraine and the modulation effect of treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839078

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Manual acupuncture (MA) is commonly used as a treatment for migraine in China. However, its specific clinical effects have been challenged on the basis that some of its effects may relate to psychological or 'placebo' mechanisms.OBJECTIVE: To identify the effectiveness of verum MA compared with sham acupuncture for the treatment of migraine.METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of verum versus sham MA on migraine. The quality of included trials was assessed using the 'risk of bias' tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Intervention. RevMan 5.2 software was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Ten trials with 997 participants were included. Most trials had high methodological quality and were at low risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed superior effects of verum MA over sham acupuncture on the total effective rate, reflected by a reduction in the 'not effective' rate (relative risk (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; p<0.0001, four trials) and a reduced recurrence rate (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.81; p=0.006, two trials), but no significant differences in headache intensity, frequency or duration, accompanying symptoms and use of medication. No severe adverse events related to acupuncture occurred during treatment with either verum or sham MA.CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence suggests that verum acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in migraine, reflected by a higher total effective rate and decreased recurrence rate. Nevertheless, further large-scale RCTs with a rigorous design are required to confirm these findings in view of the relative paucity of eligible RCTs and small sample sizes of those included.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"AbstractChronic daily headache (CDH) is a very important part of primary headache disorder, and it causes heavy socioeconomic burden. An increasing number of people are suffering from CDH, and there are many treatment choices for the different subtypes of CDH. However, the definite effect of these treatments, especially the non-pharmacologic treatments, is still unclear and controversial. Acupuncture, a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has an over 2500-year history in China as an effective non-pharmacologic method for chronic pain, but the researches on CDH are limited. Varying stimulations and the acupoints can be chosen for different acupuncturists, and there are many primary and secondary assessments of the therapeutic effect. Although acupuncture has been shown to have potential effects on CDH, it requires much deeper researches on the optimized usage and underlying mechanisms.","Liu Y, Yu S",Curr Pain Headache Rep. 2016 Jan;20(1):4. doi: 10.1007/s11916-015-0535-7.,Recent Approaches and Development of Acupuncture on Chronic Daily Headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700695
"AbstractMigraine is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders which is suggested to be associated with dysfunctions of the central nervous system. The purpose of the present study was to detect the altered functional connectivity architecture in the large-scale network of the whole brain in migraine without aura (MWoA). Meanwhile, the brain functional hubs which are targeted by MWoA could be identified. A new voxel-based method named functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping was applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 55 female MWoA patients and 44 age-matched female healthy controls (HC). Comparing to HC, MWoA patients showed abnormal short-range FCD values in bilateral hippocampus, bilateral insula, right amygdale, right anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral putamen, bilateral caudate nucleus and the prefrontal cortex. The results suggested decreased intraregional connectivity of these pain-related brain regions in female MWoA. In addition, short-range FCD values in left prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus were significantly negatively correlated with duration of disease in MWoA group, implying the repeated migraine attacks over time may consistently affect the resting-state functional connectivity architecture of these brain hubs. Our findings revealed the dysfunction of brain hubs in female MWoA, and suggested the left prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus served as sensitive neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration of female MWoA. This may provide us new insights into the changes in the organization of the large-scale brain network in MWoA.","Gao Q, Xu F, Jiang C, Chen Z, Chen H, Liao H, Zhao L",Brain Res. 2016 Feb 1;1632:73-81. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2015.12.007.

"AbstractBackground Headache is the medical problem most commonly observed by neurologists. Non-pharmacological treatments are commonly demanded by individuals with headaches, but their evidence of effectiveness is conflicting. Aim The current review provides an updated discussion on what is supported by current scientific evidence about physical therapies for tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, and cervicogenic headache (CeH), and which gaps there still may be in our understanding of the interventions. Methods PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, EBSCO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register, PEDro, and SCOPUS were searched from their inception through March 2015. Results/Discussion Several physical therapies including spinal joint manipulation/mobilization, soft tissue interventions, therapeutic exercises and needling therapies are proposed to be effective for the management of headaches. Current evidence has shown that the effectiveness of these interventions will depend on proper clinical reasoning since not all interventions are equally effective for all headache pain conditions. For instance, evidence of physical therapy in migraine is more controversial than in TTH, since migraine pathogenesis involves activation of sub-cortical structures and the trigemino-vascular system, whereas pathogenesis of TTH is more associated with musculoskeletal disorders, e.g. muscle pain. It seems that multimodal approaches including different interventions are more effective for patients with TTH, migraine and CeH.","Fernández-de-Las-Peñas C, Cuadrado ML",Cephalalgia. 2016 Oct;36(12):1134-1142. doi: 10.1177/0333102415596445.

"AbstractOnabotulinumtoxin A (BoNTA) has been reported to be effective in the therapy for migraines. Acupuncture has been used worldwide for the treatment of migraine attacks. Injection of a small amount of drug at acupuncture points is an innovation as compared to traditional acupuncture. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of fixed (muscle)-site and acupoint-site injections of BoNTA for migraine therapy in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial extending over four months. Subjects with both episodic and chronic migraines respectively received a placebo (n = 19) or BoNTA (2.5 U each site, 25 U per subject) injection at fixed-sites (n = 41) including occipitofrontalis, corrugator supercilii, temporalis and trapeziue, or at acupoint-sites (n = 42) including Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Baihui (GV20), Shuaigu (GB8), Fengchi (GB20) and Tianzhu (BL10). The variations between baseline and BoNTA post-injection for four months were calculated monthly as outcome measures. BoNTA injections at fixed-sites and acupoint-sites significantly reduced the migraine attack frequency, intensity, duration and associated symptoms for four months compared with placebo (p < 0.01). The efficacy of BoNTA for migraines in the acupoint-site group (93% improvement) was more significant than that in the fixed-site group (85% improvement) (p < 0.01). BoNTA administration for migraines is effective, and at acupoint-sites shows more efficacy than at fixed-sites. Further blinded studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of a low dose toxin (25 U) introduced with this methodology in chronic and episodic migraines.","Hou M, Xie JF, Kong XP, Zhang Y, Shao YF, Wang C, Ren WT, Cui GF, Xin L, Hou YP",Toxins (Basel). 2015 Oct 30;7(11):4442-54. doi: 10.3390/toxins7114442.,Acupoint injection of onabotulinumtoxin A for migraines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529014
"AbstractBACKGROUND: While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system.METHODS: We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only). HomeCageScan was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC.RESULTS: Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour (p<0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups (p<0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA and Model groups in behaviour or c-Fos immunoreactivity.CONCLUSIONS: EA pretreatment ameliorates behavioural changes in a rat model of recurrent migraine, possibly via modulation of the brainstem descending pathways.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Neurogenic inflammation of these rats was induced by electrical stimulation. The γ-32P infiltration method was then used to detect MLCK activation in the middle meningeal artery, and immunocytochemistry was applied to detect the structural protein expression of MLCK.RESULTS: The miaraine model was successfully established in the rats. Compared with the control group, MLCK activation was significantly decreased in the blank control group (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: The activation of MLCK in the middle meningeal artery was increased by acupuncture at Fengchi (GB 20), indicating its effectiveness in preventing and curing on acute migraine attacks.","Zhou P, Wang A, Li B, Liu C, Wang Y",J Tradit Chin Med. 2015 Jun;35(3):301-5.,Effect of acupuncture at Fengchi (GB 20) on the activity of myosin light chain kinase in the middle meningeal artery of migraine modeled rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237834

As the basis, we queried PubMed in June 2014 for articles mentioning both acupuncture and NIRS in title/abstract. The reviewed papers investigated either cerebral (n = 11) or muscular hemodynamics (n = 5) and, based on STRICTA for reporting acupuncture methodology, were overall poor in quality. Acupuncture was found to influence regional oxygen saturation in cerebral and muscular tissue. The cortical response in healthy subjects varied across studies. For subjects with stroke or cerebrovascular dementia, findings suggest that acupuncture may modulate dysfunction in cerebral autoregulation. The muscular response to pressure techniques was more intense than that to needling or laser. Probe proximity could impact measurement sensitivity. No one study simultaneously investigated the direct and remote responses. Research utilizing NIRS to investigate the hemodynamics of acupuncture presently lacks in scope and quality. Improved designs, for example, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, and standardized intervention reporting will raise study quality. Exploiting NIRS in clinical settings, such as stroke, migraine, or other pain conditions, is worthwhile.","Lo MY, Ong MW, Chen WY, Sun WZ, Lin JG",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015;2015:839470. doi: 10.1155/2015/839470.

"AbstractThe current overview includes thirty articles published in the recent past about myofascial pain, trigger points (TrPs) and related topics. In the Basic Research section, several interesting new studies are reviewed addressing the presence of TrPs in patients with low back pain, episodic migraine, or following a meniscectomy. An animal study of the impact of laser fluency opens the door to future studies regarding optimal dosage of low-level laser therapy in the treatment of individuals with TrPs. Six papers focus on TrP dry needling (DN), two on manual therapies, and two on injection therapy. On of the injection papers discusses the occurrence of a cardiac tamponade, which is a very rare potential complication of invasive needling therapies that can easily be avoided with proper needling techniques. Several review studies and other clinical studies conclude this overview.","Dommerholt J, Hooks T, Grieve R, Layton M",J Bodyw Mov Ther. 2015 Jul;19(3):482-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jbmt.2015.05.003.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the differences in clinical effect on menstrual migraine between subgaleal acupoint injection with metoclopramide and oral administration of medication.METHODS: Sixty-four patients of menstrual migraine were randomized into a subgaleal acupoint injection group and a medication group, 32 cases in each one. In the subgaleal acupoint injection group, the acupoint injection started 10 days before menstruation. Eight acupoints on the head were selected and injected alternatively in two groups, once every 2 days, 4 treatments made one session and 3 sessions (3 menstrual cycles) were required. In the medication group, flunarizine was applied with oral administration, 2.5 mg each time, once every night. The duration of treatment was 3 months. The analgesic effect, frequency and time of pain attack were observed in 3 and 6 months after treatment in the two groups.RESULTS: After treatment, VAS scores were lower than those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01, P<0.05), the attack frequency and pain time were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.01). After treatment, VAS score, the frequency and time of pain attack in the subgaleal acupoint injection group were improved significantly as compared with the medication group (all P<0.01).CONCLUSION: The subgaleal acupoint injection with metoclopramide achieves the superior preventive effect in clinical treatment of menstrual migraine as compared with flunarizine.","Wang L, Wu Y, Su X",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2015 Mar;35(3):243-6.,[Preventive effect on menstrual migraine treated with subgaleal acupoint injection with metoclopramide].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26062192
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of manual acupuncture as a prophylaxis for frequent migraine.METHODS: Fifty frequent migraineurs were randomly allocated to receive 16 sessions of either real acupuncture (RA = 26) or sham acupuncture (SA = 24) during 20 weeks. The primary outcomes were days with migraine over four weeks, duration, and intensity of migraine and the number of responders with more than 50% reduction of migraine days. The secondary outcomes were the relief medication, quality of migraine, quality of life, and pressure pain thresholds.RESULTS: The two groups were comparable at baseline. At the end of the treatment, when compared with the SA group, the RA group reported significant less migraine days (RA: 5.2 ± 5.0; SA: 10.1 ± 7.1; P = 0.008), less severe migraine (RA: 2.18 ± 1.05; SA: 2.93 ± 0.61; P = 0.004), more responders (RA: 19 versus SA: 7), and increased pressure pain thresholds. No other group difference was found. Group differences were maintained at the end of the three-month follow-up, but not at the one-year follow-up. No severe adverse event was reported.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: By using questionnaire method to understand the evaluation regarding cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for migraine in both doctors and patients.METHODS: By using questionnaire method, questionnaires for doctors and patients were made respectively; by using network platform, two sets of questionnaires were publicly released, which were filled in online. The results were real-time background collected and then analyzed.RESULTS: Totally 696 effective questionnaires for patients and 114 questionnaires for doctors were collected. The results indicated that (1)the direct cost (including treatment fee and material fee) for preventive treatment of migraine was 109 yuan per time in regular acupuncture, 152 yuan per time in regular acupuncture + electroacupuncture (EA) and 238 yuan per time in acupoint catgut embedding. The travelling expense was 42 yuan per time within the city and 193 yuan per time between cities. The indirect cost included cost for loss of working time (208 yuan per time), cost for treatment time (acupoint catgut embedding: 10 to 30 min per time, once one to three weeks; the remaining two treatments: 20 to 50 min per time, once to 5 times every week), time cost for arriving and departing hospital (1 to 3 hours per time within the city and 4 hours per time between cities). From the angle of treatment course, acupoint catgut embedding reduced the treatment frequency, leading to a lower total cost. (2)A mong the reasons to select different acupuncture methods to treat migraine, the results of patient questionnaire indicated that the focus in the patients who selected acupoint catgut embedding was different from that in the patients who selected two other treatments. The main advantage of acupoint catgut embedding was superior and lasting efficacy with low cost. The results of doctor questionnaire indicated the main reason to select acupoint catgut embedding was ""lasting efficacy after single treatment"" (87. 5%) and ""lower frequency of treatment"" (75. 0%). (3) The main reason to obstruct the popularization of acupoint catgut embedding was this method was not widely known.CONCLUSION: The acupoint catgut embedding is one ideal preventive treatment for migraine, which has higher cost-effectiveness, however, currently it is not widely applied.

"AbstractINTRODUCTION: Multiple interventions are effective for migraine prophylaxis. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is still not clear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarise the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attack.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform an umbrella systematic review to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the recommended interventions for migraine prophylaxis according to the guidelines. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews, which will be screened for RCTs. We will describe the general information of the RCTs for participants, interventions, outcome measurements, comparisons and the primary findings. Additionally, a network meta-analysis will be conducted to determine the comparative effectiveness of the treatments with a random-effects model. The absolute and relative effectiveness of the treatments will be provided. The heterogeneity and inconsistency between trials will be assessed by the I(2) statistical test and Cochrane's Q test. Risk of bias will be assessed and the overall strength of the evidence will be summarised.DISCUSSION: The result of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence of treatments for migraine prophylaxis, and it may provide a ranking of the treatments for patients and clinicians to help them select the best option.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42015015297.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension-type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension-type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension-type headache.OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension-type headache in adults.SEARCH METHODS: For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension-type headache.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension-type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period.MAIN RESULTS: The original review included six studies on tension-type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension-type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow-up ranged between two and four months.Six studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on tension-type headache frequency, the primary endpoint. At eight weeks of follow-up, we found no difference when compared to placebo (two studies, N = 127; mean difference (MD) -0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.95 to 2.03; I(2)= 0%) or amitriptyline (two studies, N = 152; MD 0.76, 95% CI -2.05 to 3.57; I(2)= 44%).When considering secondary outcomes, SSRIs reduce the symptomatic/analgesic medication use for acute headache attacks compared to placebo (two studies, N = 118; MD -1.87, 95% CI -2.09 to -1.65; I(2)= 0%). However, amitriptyline appeared to reduce the intake of analgesic more efficiently than SSRIs (MD 4.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.84; I(2)= 0%). The studies supporting these findings were considered at unclear risk of bias. We found no differences compared to placebo or other antidepressants in headache duration and intensity.SSRIs or SNRI were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events or for other reasons (four studies, N = 257; odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.60; I(2)= 25% and OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.38; I(2)= 0%).We did not find any study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non-drug therapies (e.g. psycho-behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension-type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension-type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache is not supported by evidence.","Banzi R, Cusi C, Randazzo C, Sterzi R, Tedesco D, Moja L",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 May 1;(5):CD011681. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD011681.,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the prevention of tension-type headache in adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931277
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Functional and structural abnormalities in resting-state brain networks in migraine patients have been confirmed by previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. However, few studies focusing on the neural responses of therapeutic treatment on migraine have been conducted. In this study, we tried to examined the treatment-related effects of standard acupuncture treatment on the right frontoparietal network (RFPN) in migraine patients.METHODS: A total of 12 migraine without aura (MWoA) patients were recruited to undergo resting-state fMRI scanning and were rescanned after 4 weeks standard acupuncture treatment. Another 12 matched healthy control (HC) subjects underwent once scanning for comparison. We analyzed the functional connectivity of the RFPN between MWoA patients and HC subjects before treatment and that of the MWoA patients before and after treatment. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) data analyzing was also performed to detect fiber-related treatment responses.RESULTS: We observed significantly decreased FC in the RFPN and that the decreased FC could be reversed by acupuncture treatment. The changes of FC in MWoA patients was negatively correlated with the decrease of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores after treatment. This study indicated that acupuncture treatment for MWoA patients was associated with normalizing effects on the intrinsic decreased FC of the RFPN.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided new insights into the treatment-related neural responses in MWoA patients and suggested potential functional pathways for the evaluation of treatment in MWoA patients.

"AbstractThe purpose of this study is to contribute to efforts to understand the pathophysiology of migraine and create an alternative perspective for prophylaxis and treatment of migraine attacks. Acupuncture treatment was applied to the 22 volunteer migraine patients. The acupuncture treatment consists of 5 sessions with 2 sessions per week. Blood samples have been collected before performing acupuncture, after the 1st session and after the 5th session of the acupuncture. And for the control group blood samples were collected only once. In our study the mean serum NO levels in healthy people were (3.58 ± 0.53) while patients with migraine group were (5.55 ± 0.70) respectively. Serum NO levels were 55% higher in migraine group compared to the control group. The NO concentration also decreased after 5th session (30%) (p < 0.05). After the 1st sessions NO level decreased 4.86% in the migraine group. After the 5th session NO level decreased 30.63% in the migraine group. After the 5th session NO level decreased 27.08% compared to 1st session in the migraine group. After the 1st session of acupuncture treatment, level of NO in migraine group were 4.86% and it is reduced but statistically not significant. After the 5th acupuncture treatment serum NO levels were reduced to (3.85 ± 0.62) 30.63% in migraine group and were statistically lower (p < 0.05). After the 5th session NO level decreased 27.08% compared to 1st session in the migraine group. In this study, acupuncture treatment is appeared to be effective by lowering the levels of serum NO and acupuncture has cumulative effects. Although there are earlier studies showing the effect of NO in migraine, this has been the 1st study in this field, which shows the effect of acupuncture on NO in migraine patients.","Gündüztepe Y, Mit S, Geçioglu E, Gurbuz N, Salkaci O, Severcan C, Cevik C",Acupunct Electrother Res. 2014;39(3-4):275-83.,The impact of acupuncture treatment on nitric oxide (NO) in migraine patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25693309

"AbstractChronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common complaints after mild traumatic brain injury, yet evidence to date is insufficient to direct conventional treatment of headaches with this etiology. Therefore, the current guidelines recommend a symptomatic approach for the three patterns of PTHs: migraine-like, tension-like, and mixed symptomatology. To improve response rates and minimize the potential for polypharmacy, adverse effects, and risk of dependency, effective nonpharmacologic options should be employed to support faster and safer patient rehabilitation. Current evidence shows that acupuncture is at least as effective as drug therapy for migraine prophylaxis and neurovascular and tension-type headaches. Because of its safety, cost-effectiveness, and long-lasting benefits, adjunctive acupuncture should be offered to patients with chronic PTHs and may be a valuable primary treatment alternative for those with contraindications to pharmacotherapy. Future head-to-head, adequately powered, well-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate acupuncture efficacy for PTHs.",Khusid MA,Mil Med. 2015 Feb;180(2):132-6. doi: 10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00195.,Clinical indications for acupuncture in chronic post-traumatic headache management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25643378
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To study whether a higher expectation of acupuncture measured at baseline and after acupuncture is associated with better outcome improvements in patients with migraine.METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a previous published trial in which 476 patients with migraine were randomly allocated to three real acupuncture groups and one sham acupuncture control group. All the participants received 20 sessions of acupuncture over a 4-week period. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine attack (NDMA) assessed at 5-8 weeks after randomisation. The secondary outcomes were visual analogue scale, headache intensity and quality of life assessed at 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomisation. Expectations of the acupuncture effect were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment and categorised into five levels, with 0% the lowest and 100% the highest. Outcome improvement was first compared among the participants with different expectation levels using an analysis of variance model. The association between expectations of treatment and outcome improvement was then calculated using a logistic regression model.RESULTS: Patients with 100% baseline expectations did not report significantly fewer NDMA than those with 0% baseline expectations after adjusting for the covariates (at 5-8 weeks, 1.7 vs 3.9 days, p=0.987). High baseline expectations had no significant impact on improvement of the primary outcome (100% vs 0%: OR 8.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 191.65, p=0.682). However, patients with 100% post-treatment expectations reported fewer NDMA than those with 0% expectations (primary outcome: 1.3 vs 5.0 days, p<0.001) and were more likely to have a favourable response (100% vs 0%: OR 68.87, 95% CI 6.26 to 1449.73, p=0.002). Similar results were found when analysing the impact of expectation on the secondary outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: A high level of expectation after acupuncture treatment rather than at baseline was associated with better long-term outcome improvements in patients with migraine.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00599586.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe and evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture at ""Siguan"" combined with the Gallbladder Meridian acupoints on migraine.METHODS: With randomized controlled trial design, 87 patients were randomly divided into an observation group (42 cases) and a control group (45 cases). The observation group was treated with acupuncture at ""Siguan"" including Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR 3), combined with the Gallbladder Meridian acupoints including Fengchi (GB 20), Shuaigu (GB 8), Qiuxu (GB 40) and Zulinqi (GB 41), while the control group was treated with acupuncture at the Gallbladder Meridian acupoints, including Fengchi (GB 20), Shuaigu (GB 8), Qiuxu (GB 40), Zulinqi (GB 41), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Hanyan (GB 4). The treatment was given every other day in two groups, 3 times per week for totally 6 weeks. The migraine intensity, migraine frequency and lasting time of each migraine were observed before and after treatment, and 3-month follow-up was performed after treatment. The clinical efficacy in two groups was evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with those before treatment, the migraine intensity, frequency and lasting time were all reduced significantly after treatment in the two groups (all P<0.01), which were more obvious in the observation group (all P<0.05). At the end of the treatment, the total effective rate was 95.2% (40/42) in the observation group and 80.0% (36/45) in the control group, which had statistical difference (P<0.05). After 3-month follow-up, the total effective rate was 88.1% (37/42) in the observation group and 75.6% (34/45) in the control group, which had no statistical difference (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: The ""Siguan"" combined with the Gallbladder Meridian acupoints could significantly relieve the migraine intensity, frequency and lasting time, and its improvement of symptoms and short-term efficacy are superior to those of the Gallbladder Meridian acupoints alone.","Lin XM, Yao X, Di Z",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2014 Oct;34(10):947-50.,"[Acupuncture at ""Siguan"" combined with Gallbladder Meridian acupoints for migraine: a randomized controlled trial].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543418
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture has analgesic effect to most pain conditions. Many neuroimaging studies were conducted to explore acupoint specificity in pain and other condition, but till now there is still discrepancy. Based on our previous finding, this study investigated the brain metabolism changes of acupuncture analgesia induced by sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint stimulation.METHODS: 30 migraineurs were included and randomly assigned to 3 groups: Acupuncture Group (AG), Sham Acupuncture Group (SAG) and Migraine Group (MG). In AG, a combination sub-specific points of Shaoyang meridians, Luxi (TE19), San Yangluo (TE8), and Xi Yangguan (GB33) has been stimulated with electroacupuncture, while non-acupoints for SAG were used and MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to identify differences in brain glucose metabolism between groups.RESULTS: In the AG, brain glucose metabolism increase compared with the MG was observed in the middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, the precuneus, parahippocampus, cerebellum and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and decrease were observed in the left hemisphere of Middle Temporal Cortex (MTC).In the SAG, compared with MG, glucose metabolism increased in the poster cingulate cortex (PCC), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, MTC, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, fusiform, inferior parietal lobe, superior parietal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, middle occipital lobe, angular and precuneus; while, decreased in cerebellum, parahippocampus.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture stimulation at both sub-specific acupoint and non-acupoint yields ameliorating effect to migraine pain, but with evidently differed central mechanism as measured by PET-CT. The pattern of brain glucose metabolism change in acupoint is pertinent and targeted, while in non-acupoint that was disordered and randomized. These finding may provide new perspectives into the validation of acupoint specificity, optimizing acupuncture analgesia and revealing central mechanism of acupuncture analgesia by neuroimaging measurement.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with registration no.

"AbstractMigraine is a painful condition in which patients suffer from recurrent episodes of disabling pain, which could be very severe and can lead to grave psychological disturbances. There is no curative treatment for migraine, but there are various treatment modalities, though, with conflicting reports on their efficacy. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of electro acupuncture therapy and the conventional drug therapy on the psychological profile of migraneurs based on the assessment of quality of life and disability parameters. Migraneurs (n = 60) were recruited from the Psychiatry and Neurology OPD, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. Following a written consent, migraneurs were randomly allocated into 2 study groups--Group A received 10 sittings of electro acupuncture on selected acupuncture points over a period of 30 days, while for the same duration the Group D received a conventional drug therapy in the form of oral flunarizine 20 mg OD along with paracetamol 500 mg SOS. The patients were assessed twice, before and after completion of the treatment programme (30 days). The quality of life was assessed with WHOQOL BREF (WHO Quality of Life Biomedical Research and Education Foundation) questionnaire and the disability was assessed with MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measure's ANOVA with Tukey's test. Migraneurs were found to have lower quality of life and higher disability scores but following the treatment regimes, the 2 study groups showed a significant improvement in both the parameters studied. It was however observed, that the acupuncture group showed a better response and was thus found to be more effective as compared to the drug group (P = 0.005 to 0.000). We thus conclude that acupuncture is a better treatment option than the conventional drug therapy in not only relieving the pain of migraine but in also improving the psychological profile in migraneurs. Hence its use should be encouraged as an alternative/adjunct treatment for migraine.","Vijayalakshmi I, Shankar N, Saxena A, Bhatia MS",Indian J Physiol Pharmacol. 2014 Jan-Mar;58(1):69-76.,Comparison of effectiveness of acupuncture therapy and conventional drug therapy on psychological profile of migraine patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464680
"AbstractShaoyang acupoints are the most frequently used in migraine treatment. However, the central analgesic mechanism remains poorly understood. Studies have demonstrated that single stimulus of the verum acupuncture in healthy subjects can induce significant connectivity or activity changes in pain-related central networks compared with sham acupuncture. However, these findings are not indicative of the central analgesic mechanism of acupuncture at Shaoyang acupoints. Thus, we recruited 100 migraine sufferers and randomly assigned them into five groups: Shaoyang uncommon acupoint, Shaoyang common acupoint, Yangming uncommon acupoint, non-acupoint control, and blank control groups. Subjects were subjected to evaluation of curative effects and functional MRI prior to and after 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. All subjects were diagnosed by physicians and enrolled following clinical physical examination. Subjects were observed during 1-4 weeks after inclusion. At the fifth week, the first clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI were conducted. The Shaoyang mon acupoint, Shaoyang common acupoint, Yangming uncommon acupoint, and non-acupoint control grousp then were treated with acupuncture, five times per week, 20 times in total over 4 weeks. The second and third clinical evaluations and resting functional MRI screenings were conducted following 10 and 20 acupuncture treatments. The blank control group was observed during the 5 to 8 week period, followed by clinical evaluation and resting functional MRI. The aim of this study was to examine changes in brain functional activity and central networks in subjects with migraine undergoing acu-puncture at Shaoyang uncommon acupoints. This study provides a further explanation of the central analgesic mechanism by which acupuncture at Shaoyang acupoints treats migraine.","Lan L, Gao Y, Zeng F, Qin W, Dong M, Liu M, Guo T, Liang F",Neural Regen Res. 2013 Oct 5;8(28):2649-55. doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1673-5374.2013.28.007.,A central analgesic mechanism of acupuncture for migraine: An ongoing functional MRI study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25206576

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of acupuncture on the serum matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) level and activity in patients with migraine.METHODS: After baseline testing, eligible patients with migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society who volunteered to join the study were included (n=27). The patients received 10 sessions of acupuncture treatment. The points selected were bilateral ST8, ST44, LI4, LI11, LIV3, SP6, GB1, GB14, GB20, GV14, GV20, Yintang, Taiyang and ear Shenmen. Pain was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Short form-36 (SF-36) was used to determine their quality of life. Blood samples were taken before treatment and after the first and last sessions of acupuncture for measurement of MMP-2 concentration and activity.RESULTS: The mean VAS was 85.5±16.6 before acupuncture and was significantly decreased to 39.8±20.6 after 10 sessions of acupuncture (p<0.0001). There was a significant increase in all SF-36 scores after acupuncture compared with values before treatment (p<0.0001). No significant differences were found in MMP-2 concentrations before treatment and after the first and last sessions (p>0.05). However, there were significant changes in MMP-2 activity (p<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a clinically relevant decrease in MMP-2 activity in patients with migraine treated with acupuncture. The mechanism underlying the effect of acupuncture in alleviating pain may be associated with a decrease in MMP-2 activity.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To understand the following about patients using an acupuncture teaching clinic: (1) sociodemographic characteristics and main complaints and (2) self-reported level of patient-centered outcomes regarding pain management.METHODS/DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.SUBJECTS: A total of 458 new patients at NESA clinic during October 1, 2009 to July 31, 2010 were enrolled in the study.INTERVENTIONS: A variety of styles of Oriental medicine, primarily Chinese and Japanese style acupuncture and also heat treatments (MOXA or heat lamps) and Tui Na (Asia bodywork).RESULTS: Results from Objective 1 were descriptive (n = 421). Objective 2 focused on the 59 patients from the larger sample who completed both an initial and a follow-up Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) form and who used acupuncture for pain management of (1) diseases of the musculoskeletal system and/or connective tissue or (2) migraine/headache. Both the symptom severity and activity of daily living/well-being scales of the MYMOP showed over 15.8% improvement from baseline to at least six weeks of treatment: 28.6% for Symptom 1, 19.4% for Symptom 2, 35.7% for activities of daily living, and 25.0% for well-being. The relative majority for each sociodemographic trait investigated were as follows: female, about 40 years old, white, not Hispanic or Latino, married, highly educated, and employed. Most patients were confident in acupuncture treatment. Out of the 421 acupuncture patients, 68.2% wanted acupuncture in order to manage pain. Overall, 20.6% of the patients (59, N = 287) who used acupuncture for pain management for diseases of the musculoskeletal system and/or connective tissue or migraine or headache completed the sixth-week follow-up MYMOP form. Of these patients, 57.6% (34, N = 59) returned during week 6 of the semester for acupuncture treatment and reported clinical improvement in at least one MYMOP severity score, and no score got worse.CONCLUSIONS: The information about sociodemographic characteristic and patient-centered outcomes of pain management can be used for service provision, future study planning, and marketing. Future studies should address the low follow-up rate, the quality of self-reported clinic data, and the reasons that patients chose acupuncture treatments and teaching clinics.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"AbstractThis case report describes the effectiveness of a single intervention, acupuncture, for relieving or abolishing severe migraines, menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and chronic insomnia and, thus, markedly improving quality of life. A 49-year-old woman was referred for acupuncture treatment of her daily migraines, menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and chronic insomnia. The patient had received polypharmacy treatment for these conditions for several years but had rather limited relief of her symptoms. The patient received 10 weekly or biweekly acupuncture treatments over three months. Her migraines reduced in frequency and intensity after her first acupuncture treatment, and she was able to discontinue use of her migraine medications after her eighth treatment. Subsequently, her menopausal vasomotor symptoms and chronic insomnia resolved. This case illustrates successful treatment of the symptoms of three medical conditions with a single complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine procedure, namely, acupuncture, one of the key elements of traditional Chinese medicine. The patient's medical problems had been treated for years with a multitude of medications, which led to adverse effects and little symptomatic improvement. Providers of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine and providers practicing allopathic medicine should seek treatment options for their patients that promise to be helpful for various symptoms or diseases, that is, treating the root cause rather than using polypharmacy for various symptoms.","Hammes AE, Wahner-Roedler DL, Bauer BA",Explore (NY). 2014 Jul-Aug;10(4):256-9. doi: 10.1016/j.explore.2014.04.001.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been commonly used for preventing migraine attacks and relieving pain during a migraine, although there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanism behind this method. The objectives of this study were to compare the differences in brain activities evoked by active acupoints and inactive acupoints and to investigate the possible correlation between clinical variables and brain responses.METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled trial and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. A total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks, and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fMRI scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment. The neuroimaging data indicated that long-term active acupoint therapy elicited a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response compared with acupuncture at inactive acupoints. Most of the regions were involved in the pain matrix, lateral pain system, medial pain system, default mode network, and cognitive components of pain processing. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the visual analogue scale (VAS) was significantly related to the increased average Regional homogeneity (ReHo) values in the anterior cingulate cortex in the two groups. Moreover, the decrease in the VAS was associated with increased average ReHo values in the insula which could be detected in the active acupoint group.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term active acupoint therapy and inactive acupoint therapy have different brain activities. We postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-TRC-13003635.","Zhao L, Liu J, Zhang F, Dong X, Peng Y, Qin W, Wu F, Li Y, Yuan K, von Deneen KM, Gong Q, Tang Z, Liang F",PLoS One. 2014 Jun 10;9(6):e99538. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099538. eCollection  2014.,Effects of long-term acupuncture treatment on resting-state brain activity in migraine patients: a randomized controlled trial on active acupoints and inactive acupoints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915066
"AbstractAcupuncture is becoming widely recognised as an effective method of pain relief and is being increasingly integrated within the NHS, particularly for the treatment of tension-type headache, migraine and low back pain. Acupuncture during labour has been shown by a Cochrane review to reduce labour pain intensity, increase patient satisfaction and limit the use of pharmacological analgesia (Smith et al 2011) and epidural anaesthesia (Nesheim and Kinge 2006). It may therefore be particularly suited to labouring women who wish to avoid more invasive forms of pain relief. Furthermore, women receiving acupuncture in labour appear to experience additional benefits including shorter labours and reduced rates of instrumental vaginal birth (Smith et al 2011). In the UK, intrapartum acupuncture is usually provided by professional acupuncturists, but in countries such as Germany and Scandinavia it is widely given by midwives. A midwife-delivered acupuncture service appears to be a similarly feasible and cost-effective option in the UK and is currently being piloted at University College London Hospitals NHS Trust.","Carr D, Lythgoe J","Pract Midwife. 2014 May;17(5):10, 12-5.",Use of acupuncture during labour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873111
"AbstractThe use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) in paediatric populations is considerably increased, especially for pain and chronic conditions, as demonstrated by epidemiological surveys both in Europe and in the USA. In our study, CAM was used in 76 % patients of a cohort of 124 children affected by headache (age 4-16 years; 67 % female; 70 % migraine without aura, 12 % migraine with aura, 18 % tensive headache according to IHS criteria) consecutively recruited at a Pediatric Headache University Center. CAM was used as preventive treatment in 80 % cases. The main reasons for seeking CAM were: the wish of avoiding chronic use of drugs with their related side effects, the desire of an integrated approach, the reported inefficacy of conventional medicine, and a more suitable children disposition to CAM than to pharmacological compound. Female gender, younger age, migraine without aura, parents' higher educational status, maternal use of CAM and other associated chronic conditions, correlated with CAM use (p < 0.05). 73 % patients chose CAM also to treat other diseases (i.e. allergies, colitis, asthma, insomnia, muscle-scheletric disorders and dysmenorrhoea). The most assumed CAM were: herbal remedies (64 %) such as Valeriana, Ginkgo biloba, Boswellia serrata, Vitex agnus-castus, passion flower, Linden tree; vitamins/minerals supplements (40 %) with magnesium, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, vitamin B6 or B12, Multivitamin compounds; Homeopathy (47 %) with Silicea, Ignatia Amara, Pulsatilla, Aconitum, Nux Vomica, Calcarea phosphorica; physical treatment (45 %) such as Ayurvedic massage, shiatsu, osteopathy; yoga (33 %); acupuncture (11 %). CAM-often integrated with conventional care-was auto-prescribed in 30 % of the cases, suggested by non-physician in 22 %, by the General Practitioner in 24 % and by paediatrician in 24 %. Both general practitioners and neurologists were mostly unaware of their patients' CAM use. In conclusion, neurologists should inquire for CAM use and be prepared to learn about CAM therapies or to directly interact with CAM trained experts, in order to coordinate an integrative approach to health, as especially required in paediatric headache patients and their parents. Further studies are required to investigate safety and efficacy of CAM in pediatric headache, as a possible side-medicine to conventional pharmacological approach.","Dalla Libera D, Colombo B, Pavan G, Comi G",Neurol Sci. 2014 May;35 Suppl 1:145-8. doi: 10.1007/s10072-014-1756-y.,Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in an Italian cohort of pediatric headache patients: the tip of the iceberg.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867852
"AbstractAcupuncture has been proven to be effective in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders; it acts both on the peripheral flow and on the cerebral flow. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of the insertion of PC 6 Neiguan and LR 3 Taichong acupoints on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). These effects were measured in a group of patients suffering from migraine without aura (Group M) and in a healthy control group (Group C). In the study, we included 16 patients suffering from migraine without aura, classified according to the criteria of the International Headache Society, and 14 healthy subjects as a control group. The subjects took part in the study on two different days, and on each day, the effect of a single acupoint was evaluated. Transcranial Doppler was used to measure the blood flow velocity (BFV) in the MCA. Our study showed that the stimulation of PC 6 Neiguan in both groups results in a significant and longlasting reduction in the average BFV in the MCA. After pricking LR 3 Taichong, instead, the average BFV undergoes a very sudden and marked increase; subsequently, it decreases and tends to stabilize at a slightly higher level compared with the baseline, recorded before needle insertion. Our data seem to suggest that these two acupoints have very different effects on CBF. The insertion of PC 6 Neiguan probably triggers a vasodilation in MCA, while the pricking of LR 3 Taichong determines a rapid and marked vasoconstriction.","Quirico PE, Allais G, Ferrando M, de Lorenzo C, Burzio C, Bergandi F, Rolando S, Schiapparelli P, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2014 May;35 Suppl 1:129-33. doi: 10.1007/s10072-014-1754-0.,Effects of the acupoints PC 6 Neiguan and LR 3 Taichong on cerebral blood flow in normal subjects and in migraine patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867849
"AbstractHeadaches represent the most common constellation of neurologic disorders and are a very common cause of morbidity, lost work time, and decreased quality of life among sufferers. In this article, the diagnostic features, workup, and treatment of common, nuanced, and difficult-to-diagnose headache conditions were addressed. The future will hold a number of changes, with respect to both the diagnosis and treatment of headache disorders. As the aging population continues to grow, primary care providers will need to become increasingly familiar with differentiating between benign primary and more serious secondary headache disorders and will need to be able to treat the headache disorders unique to the elderly. With respect to therapeutic options, the future for treatment of the various headache disorders is promising. With the rise in popularity of complementary medical practices, there is likely to be more research on the roles of acupuncture, herbal and alternative remedies, massage therapy, and mind-body techniques. Further, new research is suggesting that neurostimulation may be useful in certain chronic, intractable headache conditions. Finally, the pathophysiology of headache disorders is still poorly understood and there is great hope that better understanding of the underlying mechanics of headache might contribute to improved treatment modalities and better quality of life for patients.","Hale N, Paauw DS",Med Clin North Am. 2014 May;98(3):505-27. doi: 10.1016/j.mcna.2014.01.006.

"AbstractWe review the literature conjoining acupuncture, migraine, and cerebral hemodynamics. To do so, we searched PubMed in March 2013 for studies investigating cerebral hemodynamics with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and other tools in migraineurs, acupuncture recipients, and migraineurs receiving acupuncture. Our search identified 1321 distinct articles - acupuncture (n = 463), migraine (n = 866), and both (n = 8). Only three (n = 3) satisfied our inclusion criteria. Based on these three, we found the following: (1) Acupuncture may positively influence not just dynamic, but also static cerebral autoregulation during the interictal phase, depending on the intervals between sessions of acupuncture as dose units. (2) TCD can detect pretreatment differences between responders and non-responders to acupuncture, which may be predictive of clinical response. (3) ""Point-through-point"" needling (at angles connecting acupoints) may be clinically superior to standard acupuncture, thus needling angles may affect treatment effectiveness. None of the reviewed articles investigated patient responses during migraine attack. Although the 2009 Cochrane review affirmed acupuncture as effective prophylaxis for migraine, few studies investigated the cerebrovascular aspects - only analyzing arterial blood flow, but not microcirculation. Future research is warranted in monitoring brain tissue oxygenation to investigate acupuncture as both a preventive and abortive treatment for migraine, varying the type and dose interval and analyzing variations in clinical response.","Lo MY, Lin JG, Wei Ong M, Sun WZ",J Tradit Complement Med. 2013 Oct;3(4):213-20. doi: 10.4103/2225-4110.119720.,Cerebral hemodynamic responses to acupuncture in migraine patients: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716180
"AbstractBACKGROUND: In a recent individual patient data meta-analysis, acupuncture was found to be superior to both sham and non-sham controls in patients with chronic pain. In this paper we identify variations in types of sham and non-sham controls used and analyze their impact on the effect size of acupuncture.METHODS: Based on literature searches of acupuncture trials involving patients with headache and migraine, osteoarthritis, and back, neck and shoulder pain, 29 trials met inclusion criteria, 20 involving sham controls (n = 5,230) and 18 non-sham controls (n = 14,597). For sham controls, we analysed non-needle sham, penetrating sham needles and non-penetrating sham needles. For non-sham controls, we analysed non-specified routine care and protocol-guided care. Using meta-regression we explored impact of choice of control on effect of acupuncture.FINDINGS: Acupuncture was significantly superior to all categories of control group. For trials that used penetrating needles for sham control, acupuncture had smaller effect sizes than for trials with non-penetrating sham or sham control without needles. The difference in effect size was -0.45 (95% C.I. -0.78, -0.12; p = 0.007), or -0.19 (95% C.I. -0.39, 0.01; p = 0.058) after exclusion of outlying studies showing very large effects of acupuncture. In trials with non-sham controls, larger effect sizes associated with acupuncture vs. non-specified routine care than vs. protocol-guided care. Although the difference in effect size was large (0.26), it was not significant with a wide confidence interval (95% C.I. -0.05, 0.57, p = 0.1).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is significantly superior to control irrespective of the subtype of control. While the choice of control should be driven by the study question, our findings can help inform study design in acupuncture, particularly with respect to sample size. Penetrating needles appear to have important physiologic activity. We recommend that this type of sham be avoided.","MacPherson H, Vertosick E, Lewith G, Linde K, Sherman KJ, Witt CM, Vickers AJ, Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration",PLoS One. 2014 Apr 4;9(4):e93739. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093739. eCollection  2014.,Influence of control group on effect size in trials of acupuncture for chronic pain: a secondary analysis of an individual patient data meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705624

"AbstractBACKGROUND: The ""classic"" endocannabinoid (eCB) system includes the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, the eCB ligands anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and their metabolic enzymes. An emerging literature documents the ""eCB deficiency syndrome"" as an etiology in migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, psychological disorders, and other conditions. We performed a systematic review of clinical interventions that enhance the eCB system--ways to upregulate cannabinoid receptors, increase ligand synthesis, or inhibit ligand degradation.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched PubMed for clinical trials, observational studies, and preclinical research. Data synthesis was qualitative. Exclusion criteria limited the results to 184 in vitro studies, 102 in vivo animal studies, and 36 human studies. Evidence indicates that several classes of pharmaceuticals upregulate the eCB system, including analgesics (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, glucocorticoids), antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants. Clinical interventions characterized as ""complementary and alternative medicine"" also upregulate the eCB system: massage and manipulation, acupuncture, dietary supplements, and herbal medicines. Lifestyle modification (diet, weight control, exercise, and the use of psychoactive substances--alcohol, tobacco, coffee, cannabis) also modulate the eCB system.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Few clinical trials have assessed interventions that upregulate the eCB system. Many preclinical studies point to other potential approaches; human trials are needed to explore these promising interventions.","McPartland JM, Guy GW, Di Marzo V",PLoS One. 2014 Mar 12;9(3):e89566. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0089566. eCollection  2014.,Care and feeding of the endocannabinoid system: a systematic review of potential clinical interventions that upregulate the endocannabinoid system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622769

"AbstractBACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of electroacupuncture (EA) on relieving acute migraine through metabolomic study.METHODS: EA treatments were performed on both acupoints and nonacupoints on the nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine rat model. NMR experiments and multivariate analysis were used for metabolomic analysis.RESULTS: The number of head-scratching, the main ethology index of migraine rat model, was significantly increased (P < 0.01) after NTG injection. The plasma metabolic profile of model group was distinct from that of the control group. Glutamate was significantly increased (P < 0.01), whereas lipids were significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in model rats. After EA at acupoints, the metabolic profile of model rats was normalized, with decreased glutamate (P < 0.05) and increased lipids (P < 0.01). In contrast, EA at nonacupoints did not restore the metabolic profile, but with six metabolites significantly different from acupoints group. Interestingly, the number of head-scratching and glutamate level were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after receiving EA at both acupoints and nonacupoints.CONCLUSIONS: EA at acupoints may relieve acute migraine by restoring the plasma metabolic profile and plasma glutamate, while EA at nonacupoints may modestly relieve acute migraine by decreasing plasma glutamate.","Gao Z, Liu X, Yu S, Zhang Q, Chen Q, Wu Q, Liu J, Sun B, Fang L, Lin J, Zhu BM, Yan X, Liang F",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2014;2014:659268. doi: 10.1155/2014/659268.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the relationship of family history of headache and family history of psychiatric disorders on self-reported health care utilization tendencies for migraine treatment.BACKGROUND: Familial aggregation of both migraine and depression has been well established in the literature. Family history of headache and psychiatric disorders could influence health care utilization tendencies for migraine.METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of patients with severe migraine (n = 225) who answered questions about their family history, previous headache treatment history, disability (Headache Disability Inventory), and psychiatric symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory). Using regression, we examined the relationship between family history of headache, depression, and anxiety and reported headache-related health care utilization.RESULTS: Participants reported family histories of headache (67.6%), anxiety (15.6%), and depression (29.3%). Participants reported seeing a physician for headache an average of 3.1 (standard deviation = 3.8) times in the past 2 years. In a 2-year period, 27.6% of participants reported seeing a general practitioner and 18.5% of participants reported seeing a neurologist. Twenty-eight percent of participants went to urgent care for headaches at least once in the last 2 years. Thirty-nine percent of participants reported using non-pharmacologic treatment for headache in the prior 2 years, with the highest rates of chiropractic manipulation (27.1%) and massage (18.2%), and fewest rates of biofeedback (0.4%), relaxation training (4.4%), psychotherapy (1.8%), physical therapy (4.9%), or acupuncture (1.8%). Family history of anxiety was associated with trying non-pharmacologic treatments for headache, but no other self-reported health care utilization variable. However, neither family history of headache nor family history of depression was associated with self-reported health care utilization tendencies. Headache Disability Inventory was associated with self-reported non-pharmacologic treatments for headache.CONCLUSIONS: Family history of anxiety, but not depression, was associated with utilizing non-pharmacologic treatments for headache. Also, disability was associated with utilizing non-pharmacologic treatments for headache. However, participants reported low rates of utilization for non-pharmacologic treatments with grade-A evidence.© 2014 American Headache Society.","Minen MT, Seng EK, Holroyd KA",Headache. 2014 Mar;54(3):485-92. doi: 10.1111/head.12300.

"AbstractA pathogenic role for Th17 cells in inflammatory renal disease is well established. The mechanisms underlying their counter-regulation are, however, largely unknown. Recently, Th17 lineage-specific regulatory T cells (Treg17) that depend on activation of the transcription factor Stat3 were identified. We studied the function of Treg17 in the nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) model of crescentic GN. The absence of Treg17 cells in Foxp3(Cre)×Stat3(fl/fl) mice resulted in the aggravation of NTN and skewing of renal and systemic immune responses toward Th17. Detailed analysis of Stat3-deficient Tregs revealed that the survival, activation, proliferation, and suppressive function of these cells remained intact. However, Tregs from Foxp3(Cre)×Stat3(fl/fl) mice lacked surface expression of the chemokine receptor CCR6, which resulted in impaired renal trafficking. Furthermore, aggravation of NTN was reversible in the absence of Th17 responses, as shown in CD4(Cre)×Stat3(fl/fl) mice lacking both Treg17 and Th17 cells, suggesting that Th17 cells are indeed the major target of Treg17 cells. Notably, immunohistochemistry revealed CCR6-bearing Treg17 cells in kidney biopsy specimens of patients with GN. CCR6 expression on human Treg17 cells also appears dependent on STAT3, as shown by analysis of Tregs from patients with dominant-negative STAT3 mutations. Our data indicate the presence and involvement of Stat3/STAT3-dependent Treg17 cells that specifically target Th17 cells in murine and human crescentic GN, and suggest the kidney-specific action of these Treg17 cells is regulated by CCR6-directed migration into areas of Th17 inflammation.","Kluger MA, Luig M, Wegscheid C, Goerke B, Paust HJ, Brix SR, Yan I, Mittrücker HW, Hagl B, Renner ED, Tiegs G, Wiech T, Stahl RA, Panzer U, Steinmetz OM",J Am Soc Nephrol. 2014 Jun;25(6):1291-302. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2013080904.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being used as adjunctive treatment in primary headache syndromes in many countries. In the Turkish population, no epidemiologic data have been reported about awareness and usage of these treatments in patients with headache.METHODS: One hundred and ten primary headache patients attending three headache clinics completed a questionnaire regarding their headaches, the known modalities and the use and effect of CAM procedures for their headaches.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7±9.6 years (32.8-36.5). Almost two-thirds of patients had completed high school and university, and one-third of patients were housewives. Migraine without aura (45.5%) was the most frequently diagnosed type of headache followed by migraine with aura (19.1%) and tension-type headache (18.2%). In 43.6% of the patients, headache frequency was 5-10 per month. The most frequently known CAM modalities were massage (74.5%), acupuncture (44.5%), yoga (31.8%), exercise (28.2%), psychotherapy (25.5%), and rosemary (23.6%). The most frequently used CAM treatments were massage (51%) and exercise (11%). Only massage was reported to be beneficial in one-third of the primary headache patients; the other modalities were not.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the subgroup of primary headache patients in Turkey seek and use alternative treatments, frequently in combination with standard treatments. Neurologists should become more knowledgeable regarding CAM therapies; further randomized and controlled clinical researches with large sample sizes are needed.","Karakurum Göksel B, Coşkun Ö, Ucler S, Karatas M, Ozge A, Ozkan S",Agri. 2014;26(1):1-7. doi: 10.5505/agri.2014.04909.,Use of complementary and alternative medicine by a sample of Turkish primary headache patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481577
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) is an effective alternative treatment in migraine headache. The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effect of Yamamoto new scalp acupuncture (YNSA), a recently developed microcupuncture system, with TCA for the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headache.METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with migraine headache were assigned to receive YNSA or TCA. A pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and migraine therapy assessment questionnaire (MTAQ) were completed before treatment, after 6 and 18 sections of treatment, and 1 month after completion of therapy.RESULTS: All the recruited patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Frequency and severity of migraine attacks, nausea, the need for rescue treatment, and work absence rate decreased similarly in both groups. Recovery from headache and ability to continue daily activities 2 hours after medical treatment showed similar improvement in both groups (p>0.05).CONCLUSION: Classic acupuncture and YNSA are similarly effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headache and may be considered as alternatives to pharmacotherapy.","Rezvani M, Yaraghi A, Mohseni M, Fathimoghadam F",J Altern Complement Med. 2014 May;20(5):371-4. doi: 10.1089/acm.2013.0120.

"AbstractCONTEXT: Migraine headaches are common, debilitating, underdiagnosed, and undertreated, and medications are not always effective. Research has shown that acupuncture may be an effective and safe adjuvant or alternative migraine treatment.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether a standardized set of acupuncture points, when used to deliver treatment over a predefined period of time, could reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines.DESIGN: This is a prospective interventional study using set point acupuncture for migraines.SETTING: The study took place at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown, PA, USA.PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 59 individuals with a diagnosis of migraine.INTERVENTION: Acupuncture was administered 2 ×/wk for 4 wks, followed by 1 ×/wk for 4 more wks, using one set of acupoints.OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants collected daily headache diaries and migraine quality-of-life measurements on a personal digital assistant for 12 wks before starting the acupuncture intervention. Participants continued to record the frequency and intensity of their migraines during the intervention and for an additional 12 wks beyond the intervention. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were completed 4 × during the study: 12 wks prior to the start of the intervention, immediately prior to the first acupuncture treatment, at the end of treatment, and 12 wks after the end of treatment.RESULTS: When preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements, migraine frequency and pain intensity showed a significant decrease (α = 0.05) after acupuncture intervention. Results had not returned to the preintervention baseline even 12 wks after the last acupuncture session. Acupuncture significantly influenced migraine frequency and intensity in the study's participants when preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that not only did acupuncture decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines, but also the benefit had not subsided for 12 wks after the final acupuncture session. Validated survey measurements used to assess migraine impact on quality of life showed statistically significant improvement over baseline.","Plank S, Goodard JL, Pasierb L, Simunich TJ, Croner JR",Altern Ther Health Med. 2013 Nov-Dec;19(6):32-7.,Standardized set-point acupuncture for migraines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254036

Eligibility criteria were: controlled randomised clinical trials (RCT), conducted on patients with migraine or TTH, in which the therapeutic intervention was based on therapeutic exercise, and the papers had been published in English and Spanish. Two independent reviewers performed the analysis of the methodological quality using the Delphi scale.RESULTS: Ten RCT were selected, seven of which offered good methodological quality. According to all the studies analysed, the intensity and frequency of pain diminished in comparison to the situation prior to establishing therapeutic exercise, and in five studies the effect was higher than in the control group. The qualitative analysis showed strong evidence of the absence of adverse events following the application of therapeutic exercise. Furthermore, strong evidence was also found of the effect of physiotherapeutic treatment, including therapeutic exercise, in lowering the intensity, frequency and duration of pain in patients with TTH. Limited evidence was also found of the effectiveness of aerobic exercise in patients with migraine, although it was not better than the effects derived from other forms of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Results show that therapeutic exercise is a safe treatment that provides beneficial effects on migraines or TTH.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Menstrual-related migraine is a common form of migraine affecting >50% of female migraineurs. Acupuncture may be a choice for menstrual-related migraine, when pharmacological prophylaxis is not suitable. However, the efficacy of acupuncture has not been confirmed. We design and perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with naproxen in menstrual-related migraine patients.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 184 participants will be randomly assigned to two different groups. Participants will receive verum acupuncture and placebo medicine in the treatment group, while participants in the control group will be treated with sham acupuncture and medicine (Naproxen Sustained Release Tablets). All treatments will be given for 3 months (menstrual cycles).The primary outcome measures are the change of migraine days inside the menstrual cycle and the proportion of responders (defined as the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the number of menstrual migraine days). The secondary outcome measures are the change of migraine days outside the menstrual cycle, duration of migraine attack, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and intake of acute medication.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common types of headache, with significant socioeconomic effects. Prophylactic drugs are used to prevent migraine headaches but are unpromising.OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of adding acupuncture to conventional migraine prophylaxis.METHODS: One hundred patients with migraine (41 male, 59 female), in whom prophylactic drugs had not produced a fall of at least 50% in the number of attacks, entered the study. The patients were randomised into two groups, sham and true acupuncture. The patients in both groups continued their prophylactic treatment and received 12 sessions of either true or sham acupuncture. Each session was 30 min and was repeated three times a week. The number of headaches in the two groups was compared at baseline, and at the end of four successive months.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the frequency of attacks between the two groups before intervention. After 1 month, the frequency of attacks each month decreased from 5.1 (0.8) to 3.4 (1.2) in the true acupuncture group, and from 5.0 (0.8) to 4.4 (1.1) in the sham acupuncture group (a significant difference, p<0.001). The frequency continued to decrease in month 2 but increased in months 3 and 4; however, it was still significantly lower than baseline, and the difference remained significant after month 4.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is applicable as an adjunct to prophylactic drugs in migraineurs in whom the number of attacks does not fall with prophylactic medication.","Foroughipour M, Golchian AR, Kalhor M, Akhlaghi S, Farzadfard MT, Azizi H",Acupunct Med. 2014 Feb;32(1):12-6. doi: 10.1136/acupmed-2013-010362.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: The instant-treatment effect of acupuncture for patients with migraines has been corroborated in numerous studies. However, most diseases are chronic and tend to recur, so the long-term effect of acupuncture can verify the existence of sustained efficacy or the placebo effect. Evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura (MWoA) in China is also important because such studies are lacking.METHODS: This trial is a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial. We will randomly allocate 249 participants to three groups of 83. Patients in the individualized acupoint group will be treated with individualized acupuncture point prescriptions. The non-acupoint control group will undergo insertion of acupuncture needles at four bilateral non-points in locations not corresponding to acupuncture points. The waiting-list control group will not undergo treatment but instead will receive 20 acupuncture treatments for free after a waiting period of 24 weeks. Participants in the individualized acupoint group and non-acupoint control group will receive 20 sessions over four weeks and then all participants will receive 20 weeks of follow-up.DISCUSSION: The results of our trial will help to supply evidence for the long-term acupuncture effect for MWoA in a long follow-up period, and special attention will be paid to comparison with the placebo effect.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01687660) on 18 September 2012.","Chen J, Zhao L, Zheng H, Li Y, Yang M, Chang X, Gong B, Huang Y, Liu Y, Liang F",Trials. 2013 Oct 30;14:361. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-14-361.,Evaluating the prophylaxis and long-term effectiveness of acupuncture for migraine without aura: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171782
"AbstractBACKGROUND: At present, the design of an ideal placebo control in acupuncture studies challenges researchers. Previously devised sham acupuncture techniques have reported various imperfections; therefore, the specific effects of acupuncture cannot be accurately examined in clinical trials primarily because of interferences from the placebo effects.METHOD: Guided by evidence-based medicine (EBM) theories, we have made an initial attempt to establish a set of control methods for use in acupuncture studies, which is named the target disease-guided placebo-controlled (TIGER) design. In a trial using the TIGER design, participants suffering simultaneously from a predefined target disease and a pseudo target disease will be recruited and randomized to receive identical acupuncture intervention measures. As a result, the interventions not only appear the same but also produce the same stimulations in both groups. The patients in the treatment group will be informed of the actual target disease that the treatment aims for, whereas patients in the control group will be informed that the treatment is for the pseudotarget disease. It is speculated that no psychological response will be aroused in the control group. During data analysis, changes in the outcome measures of the patients in the control groupreveal the real therapeutic effect of acupuncture, and those of patients in the treatment group show both the real and placebo acupuncture effect. In this article, we explain how to put this design into use in a planned randomized clinical trial of acupuncture for the treatment of migraine.RESULTS: This approach can eliminate the acupuncture placebo effect in the control group that may confound trial results. It is possible to observe the specific and placebo effects of acupuncture for the target disease separately using the TIGER design.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed TIGER design has limitations. It is designed for clinical studies focusing on the specific effects of acupuncture, and it needs to be tested and verified for practicality and feasibility in various clinical research settings.","Zheng W, Wang H, Zhang L, Bian Z, Shang H",Trials. 2013 Oct 29;14:359. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-14-359.,Target dIsease-Guided placEbo-contRolled (TIGER) design: a novel method for clinical trials of acupuncture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168427
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Advanced neuroimaging approaches have been employed to prove that migraine was a central nervous system disorder. This study aims to examine resting-state abnormalities in migraine without aura (MWoA) patients stratified by disease duration, and to explore the neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration.METHODS: 40 eligible MWoA patients and 20 matched healthy volunteers were included in the study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis was used to identify the local features of spontaneous brain activity in MWoA patients stratified by disease duration, and analysis was performed to investigate the correlation of overlapped brain dysfunction in MWoA patients with different disease duration (long-term and short-term) and course of disease.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, MWoA patients with long-term disease duration showed comprehensive neuronal dysfunction than patients with short-term disease duration. In addition, increased average ReHo values in the thalamus, brain stem, and temporal pole showed significantly positive correlations with the disease duration. On the contrary, ReHo values were negatively correlated with the duration of disease in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, posterior cingulate cortex and superior occipital gyrus.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of progressive brain damage in relation to increasing disease duration suggest that migraine without aura is a progressive central nervous disease, and the length of the disease duration was one of the key reasons to cause brain dysfunction in MwoA patients. The repeated migraine attacks over time result in resting-state abnormalities of selective brain regions belonging to the pain processing and cognition. We predict that these brain regions are sensitive neuroimaging markers for reflecting the disease duration of migraine patients without aura.","Zhao L, Liu J, Dong X, Peng Y, Yuan K, Wu F, Sun J, Gong Q, Qin W, Liang F",J Headache Pain. 2013 Oct 17;14:85. doi: 10.1186/1129-2377-14-85.,Alterations in regional homogeneity assessed by fMRI in patients with migraine without aura stratified by disease duration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24134520
"AbstractIMPORTANCE: When analyzing results of randomized clinical trials, the treatment with the greatest specific effect compared with its placebo control is considered to be the most effective one. Although systematic variations of improvements in placebo control groups would have important implications for the interpretation of placebo-controlled trials, the knowledge base on the subject is weak.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether different types of placebo treatments are associated with different responses using the studies of migraine prophylaxis for this analysis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We searched relevant sources through February 2012 and contacted the authors to identify randomized clinical trials on the prophylaxis of migraine with an observation period of at least 8 weeks after randomization that compared an experimental treatment with a placebo control group. We calculated pooled random-effects estimates according to the type of placebo for the proportions of treatment response. We performed meta-regression analyses to identify sources of heterogeneity. In a network meta-analysis, direct and indirect comparisons within and across trials were combined. Additional analyses were performed for continuous outcomes.EXPOSURE: Active migraine treatment and the placebo control conditions.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of treatment responders, defined as having an attack frequency reduction of at least 50%. Other available outcomes in order of preference included a reduction of 50% or greater in migraine days, the number of headache days, or headache score or a significant improvement as assessed by the patients or their physicians.RESULTS: Of the 102 eligible trials, 23 could not be included in the meta-analyses owing to insufficient data. Sham acupuncture (proportion of responders, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.30-0.47]) and sham surgery (0.58 [0.37-0.77]) were associated with a more pronounced reduction of migraine frequency than oral pharmacological placebos (0.22 [0.17-0.28]) and were the only significant predictors of response in placebo groups in multivariable analyses (P = .005 and P = .001, respectively). Network meta-analysis confirmed that more patients reported response in sham acupuncture groups than in oral pharmacological placebo groups (odds ratio, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.30-2.72]). Corresponding analyses for continuous outcomes showed similar findings.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Sham acupuncture and sham surgery are associated with higher responder ratios than oral pharmacological placebos. Clinicians who treat patients with migraine should be aware that a relevant part of the overall effect they observe in practice might be due to nonspecific effects and that the size of such effects might differ between treatment modalities.","Meissner K, Fässler M, Rücker G, Kleijnen J, Hróbjartsson A, Schneider A, Antes G, Linde K",JAMA Intern Med. 2013 Nov 25;173(21):1941-51. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.10391.,Differential effectiveness of placebo treatments: a systematic review of migraine prophylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24126676
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture (EA), auricular acupuncture and bloodletting therapies combined with orthogonal design for migraine patients, so as to select a better scheme for relieving headache.METHODS: total of 76 migraine patients in the stage of attack were recruited in the present study and randomly (stratified random and central random) allocated to 9 groups by means of orthogonal experimental design [L9 (3(4)), 4 factors (F) and three levels (L)] i.e., F1: ody-acupoints combination; F1-L1: regional acupoints [Sizhukong (TE 23), Shuaigu (GB 8), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), etc.] near the focus, F1-L2:regional +distal acupoints [Hegu (L 4), Taichong (LR 3), etc.] far from the focus, and F1-L3:regional + remote acupoints+ those selected according to syndrome differentiation [for instance, Ganshu (BL 18), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Qiuxu (GB 40) and Taixi (KI 3) for hyperactivity of Liver-yang, etc.]; F2: manual acupuncture or EA of body acupoints; F2-L1:no acupuncture stimulation, F2-L2:manual acupuncture stimulation, and F2-L3:manual + EA stimulation; F3: auricular acupuncture therapy; F3-L1:no acupuncture stimulation, F3-L2: otopoint-manual acupuncture (Shenmen, Jiaogan, etc.), and F3-L3:otopoint-EA; F4: bloodletting; F4-L1 : EX-HN 5 + Ashi point bloodletting, F4-L2:EX-HN5 bloodletting, and F4-L3: no bloodletting. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture was evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and analyzed by investigators who did not participate in the treatment course.RESULTS: Within 24 hours after the treatment, the four factors influencing headache relief from bigger to smaller are body-acupoints combination > manual acupuncture or EA stimulation > bloodletting > auricular acupuncture. Among the therapeutic schemes evaluated by orthogonal deduction, the analgesic effect was most stable in the manual acupuncture at regional + distal acupoints group which was recommended to be the ba-sic scheme for migraine. The auricular EA could effectively reduce VAS levels from 10 min to 30 min after stimulation, while bloodletting at Taiyang (EX-HN 5)+ Ashi points was effective in relieving migraine from 4 h to 24 h after the treatment, suggesting a long lasting post-therapeutic analgesic effect.CONCLUSION: Manual acupuncture stimulation of the local + distal body acupoints combined with otopoint-EA and bloodletting at Taiyang (EX-HN 5) + Ashi points is the best option for relieving migraine during attack.","Wang JJ, Wu ZC, Hu J, Jiao Y, Zheng JY, Wang QM",Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2013 Jun;38(3):234-40.,[Optimized schemes for acupuncture treatment of migraine during attack].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24006671

Bu nedenle dünyanın pek çok yerinde tamamlayıcı ve alternatif tedavi (TAT) yöntemleri arayışı vardır. Türkiye’de TAT yöntemleri nörologlar tarafından önerilmese de, geleneksel tedavi yöntemlerinden fayda görmeyen hastalar alternatif tedavi yöntemleri aramaktadır. Akupunktur, botulinum toksin, akıl-vücut işbirliğini kullanan yöntemler, elementler ve bitkisel maddeler en sık kullanılanlarıdır. Bu derlemede bu tedavi yöntemlerinin mevcut kanıtları tartışılacaktır.Although many patients with migraine get positive benefits from conventional pharmacological treatments, many others do not benefit sufficiently or experience adverse effects from these treatments. For that reason, these patients usually seek complementary and/or alternative medical (CAM) treatments all over the world. In general, although CAM therapies are not recommended by neurologist in Turkey, most of migraine patients, who do not respond conventional medicine treatments, seek alternative therapy. Acupuncture, botulinum toxin, mind-body interventions, and nutraceutical options are the most popular treatments.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Chronic headache is associated with disability and high utilisation of health care including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).FINDINGS: We investigated self-reported efficacy of CAM in people with chronic headache from the general population. Respondents with possible self-reported chronic headache were interviewed by physicians experienced in headache diagnostics. CAM queried included acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naprapathy, physiotherapy, psychological treatment, and psychomotor physiotherapy. Sixty-two % and 73% of those with primary and secondary chronic headache had used CAM.Self-reported efficacy of CAM ranged from 0-43% without significant differences between gender, headache diagnoses, co-occurrence of migraine, medication use or physician contact.CONCLUSION: CAM is widely used, despite self-reported efficacy of different CAM modalities is modest in the management of chronic headache.","Kristoffersen ES, Aaseth K, Grande RB, Lundqvist C, Russell MB",J Headache Pain. 2013 Apr 18;14:36. doi: 10.1186/1129-2377-14-36.,Self-reported efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine: the Akershus study of chronic headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23596996
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The pharmacologic treatment of migraine still remains below the expectations. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture and valproic acid in migraine prophylaxis.METHODS: A prospective, controlled study was performed in 100 patients affected by migraine without aura lasting for over one year. The patients were stratified for sex and randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients each. Patients belonging to Group A (acupuncture) were submitted to 20 sessions of acupuncture, while patients belonging to Group V valproate) were administered Valproic acid (Depakin Chrono®) at a dose of 600 mg/day; 10 mg Rizatriptan wafers were allowed as needed to treat the attacks. The Midas Index (MI) and pain intensity (PI, by VAS) were recorded before treatment (T0), at three (T1) and six (T2) months; a six-point scale Pain Relief score (PRS), the Rizatriptan intake and adverse events were recorded at T1 and T2.RESULTS: Eighty-two out of 100 patients completed the study (9 dropouts in each group). In both groups the MI improved at T1 and T2 (P<0.0001). Pain intensity was better at T1 in group V (P<0.0001), but PI and PRS (P=0.02) as well as rizatriptan intake (P=0.001) were better in group A at T2. The rate of adverse events was 47.8% in group V and 0% in group A.CONCLUSION: Our data show a lower pain intensity and lower Rizatriptan intake at six-months follow-up with no adverse events in acupuncture patients compared to those treated with valproic acid.","Facco E, Liguori A, Petti F, Fauci AJ, Cavallin F, Zanette G",Minerva Anestesiol. 2013 Jun;79(6):634-42.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case study is to describe the treatment using acupuncture and spinal manipulation for a patient with a chronic tension-type headache and episodic migraines.CLINICAL FEATURES: A 32-year-old woman presented with headaches of 5 months' duration. She had a history of episodic migraine that began in her teens and had been controlled with medication. She had stopped taking the prescription medications because of gastrointestinal symptoms. A neurologist diagnosed her with mixed headaches, some migrainous and some tension type. Her headaches were chronic, were daily, and fit the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria of a chronic tension-type headache superimposed with migraine.INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: After 5 treatments over a 2-week period (the first using acupuncture only, the next 3 using acupuncture and chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy), her headaches resolved.

"AbstractThis study compares the clinical effectiveness of somatic and ear acupuncture for treatment of migraine without aura. 35 patients were divided into 2 groups, one receiving somatic and the other ear acupuncture. Both groups were treated once a week for 8 weeks and needles were stimulated manually. The severity of pain was evaluated with the Migraine Index and the visual analogue of Scott-Huskisson; other 2 tests were used to monitor the pain threshold and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale was applied to assess variations in patients' mood. These tests were performed before the beginning and at the end of treatment and, for the follow up, after 1, 3 and 6 months from the end of therapy. On the basis of the migraine index, pain at the end of therapy was significantly lower than before the treatment, being residual pain 54.83% and 63.43%, respectively for somatic and ear acupuncture. Apparently, the 2 treatments were equally effective, as no significant difference could be assessed. On the contrary, a significant difference between the 2 groups was clear during the follow up: in fact, after 6 months residual pain was 16.80% and 48.83% for somatic and ear acupuncture, respectively (p=0.038). These results were confirmed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) test and by the evaluation of pain threshold. It is noteworthy that also Zung's depression test showed a significant decrease of score was present in both groups, at all the times investigated with no difference between the two treatments. These results, though preliminary, are quite promising in supporting the effectiveness of ear acupuncture for treatment of migraine without aura.","Ceccherelli F, Lovato A, Piana E, Gagliardi G, Roveri A",Acupunct Electrother Res. 2012;37(4):277-93.,"Somatic acupuncture versus ear acupuncture in migraine therapy: a randomized, controlled, blind study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23409612
"AbstractBACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify predictive factors of outcome in patients with chronic migraine (CM) treated with acupuncture or topiramate in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive CM patients were treated with either acupuncture (n=33) or topiramate (n=33) in a 12-week period. Data on potential predictive factors were collected at baseline, and secondary data analysis was performed to identify factors associated with treatment response. Treatment prognosis was defined as the change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks from the 4-week baseline periods.RESULTS: The median change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks for patients with higher baseline headache days (>20 d) was significantly greater than that for lower baseline headache days (≤ 20 d) (median ± interquartile range: -12 ± 2 vs. -10 ± 1 d, P=0.01) in acupuncture group. There was a greater change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks for high moderate/severe headache days (>20 d) than in low days (≤ 20 d) (-12 ± 1 vs. -10 ± 2 d, P=0.015) in acupuncture group. patients with throbbing symptoms had better prognosis with acupuncture than those without throbbing (-12 ± 2 vs. -9.5 ± 2.5 d, P=0.004). Higher score (>5 points) in the general expectations for improvement predicted better response in both treatment groups (>5 vs. ≤ 5 points: -12 ± 2 vs. -9 ± 2 d for acupuncture group; -10 ± 3 vs. -7 ± 4 d for topiramate group; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Some variables can predict outcome in acupuncture or topiramate treatment of CM patients.

"AbstractAbout 2% of the adult population has chronic migraine with only 20% diagnosed with this disorder. Those with medication overuse may improve with withdrawal of overuse medications. The intravenous dihydroergotamine regimen usually produces short-term benefit for those with medically refractory chronic migraine. OnabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have shown efficacy in large placebo-controlled randomized trials. Sodium valproate, gabapentin, tizanidine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, zonisamide, and possibly memantine may be alternative or possibly combined treatment options but with lesser levels of evidence supporting their use. Preliminary evidence suggests that nerve blocks might be beneficial. Acupuncture, biofeedback, relaxation therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy might be of benefit.

"AbstractNeuropathic pain is a complicated symptomatic disease as migraine in recent years. Not because the pain character differed from the nociceptive inflammatory symptoms but because of its complexity of mechanisms. Though peripheral sensitization, ectopic discharge, central sensitization, central re-organization and loss of inhibition play part of roles in mechanisms, however, based on this mechanistic treatment, the outcome still disappointed physicians and patients, exampled as central post-stroke central pain (CPSP). The pain reduction is far less than the expectation from patients and physician's under-treatment frequently occur due to the fear of adverse effects or off-label use of these anti-neuropathic pain drugs. Therefore, a multidisciplinary procedure including non-pharmacological management, rehabilitation program, careful explanation, stepwise pain reduction, daily diary record, and tailored individual planning for medications are helpful in treating this kind of sufferers. Pharmacological treatment is the mainstream in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), central post-stroke pain (CPSP), trigeminal neuralgia (TN), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), cancer pain, failed back syndrome etc, while polypharmacy is still the major prescriptions facing such kind of miserable patients. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers, selective non-epinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), opioid or morphine etc, are still evidence-based medicines (EBM) but with different outcome for individuals. Acupuncture is to some extend effective in Taiwanese people with perceived evidence or placebo. The Taiwan guidance for total pain management and review of EBM in treating neuropathic pain from neurological point of view will be introduced in this manuscript.","Yang CM, Chen NC, Shen HC, Chou CH, Yeh PS, Lin HJ, Chang CY, Cheng TJ, Lin KC",Acta Neurol Taiwan. 2012 Sep;21(3):136-44.,[Guideline of neuropathic pain treatment and dilemma from neurological point of view].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196735
"AbstractWe use two oriental medical techniques in headache management. One is topological microstimulation, and the other is acupuncture point BL10 (Tianzhu) block. 1. Topological microstimulation The topological microstimulation apparatus delivers programmed fluctuating electrical signals to electrodes placed on the distal portion of the limbs, where meridians are concentrated. Topological microstimulation adjusts ""qi-blood-fluid"" circulating through meridians. ""Qi-blood-fluid"" is a virtual concept of oriental medicine that means 3 elements (qi, blood, and colorless body fluid). Topological microstimulation induces natural healing power through the bio-homeostatic function, and reduces chronic intractable pain. 2. Acupuncture point BL10 (Tianzhu) block Tianzhu as a meridian point is located at the intersection of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone and lateral border of the trapezius. This site is located in the superficial layer of the trunk of the greater occipital nerve. Tianzhu block has therapeutic effects on the trigeminocervical complex. As a result, various types of headache are relieved. Tianzhu block was performed in 50 patients in our clinic, and marked effects were observed in 6 patients, moderate effects in 22, slight effects in 19, and no effects in 3. According to the type of headache, this block was effective in 47% of patients with tension-type headache, 38% of those with migraine, 50% of those with chronic daily headache, and 71% of those with neck and/or shoulder pain. Conclusion Various somatic and mental stresses induce headache and functional somatic syndrome, i.e., Tianzhu syndrome. Acupuncture is useful and can be actively recommended for the management of intractable headache such as complicated headache due to Tianzhu syndrome.",Manaka S,Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2012;52(11):1299-302.,[Application of acupuncture as a headache management tool].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196598
"AbstractAcupuncture is known as the effective tool for headache, but the mechanism of the effect is unknown. We already revealed the acupuncture effect in the clinical team of headache center in Keio University Hospital. Therefore, we tried to establish the animal model for elucidation of mechanism of acupuncture effect in the pathophysiology of headache. Resent study, we reveal the threshold-reduction of the genesis of the cortical spreading depression (CSD; thought as the trigger of migraine attack) during the trigeminal nerve stimulation. This result suggests that, the somatosensory stimulation may influence the occurrence and severity of the pathogenesis of migraine. Furthermore, we assume that our result may lead to the underlying mechanism of acupuncture effect.","Toriumi H, Ebine T, Kuroi T, Mamoru S, Shimizu T, Suzuki N",Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2012;52(11):1297-8.,[Acupuncture; as a valuable tool for headache].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196597
"AbstractThe greatest number of patients in our department are those referred from the Department of Neurology. These patients usually present symptoms or conditions such as peripheral facial paralysis, primary headache, or cerebrovascular disorders; acupuncture and moxibustion treatment have resulted in an overall favorable effect. Regarding the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment on the prevention of migraine attacks, a two-month course of acupuncture has been shown to decrease the number of days with a slight or moderate headache. Furthermore, we have seen a relation between the alleviation of headache and that of muscular tenderness in the neck-shoulder region and masticatory muscles. The results of Arterial Spin-Labeling MRI, by which we determine changes in cerebral blood flow before and after acupuncture stimulation in patients with migraine, have revealed that acupuncture stimulation induces an increase of blood flow in the thalamus and hypothalamus, opercular part, cingulate gyrus, and islet. This differs from the response obtained in healthy individuals. It has been shown that acupuncture and moxibustion for tension headache is highly effective and the action mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion is associated with relaxation of masticatory muscles hypertonicity in the neck-shoulder region and normalization of circulation dynamics, contributing thereby to the alleviation of headache. Moreover, the automatic nervous system has been found to be related to such analgesic mechanism. Based on our experience, we consider that traditional medicine based on acupuncture and moxibustion is highly effective in patients with neurological symptoms.","Yamaguchi S, Araki N",Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2012;52(11):1287-9.,[The practical use of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment cooperated with neurological practice].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196594

"AbstractBACKGROUND: In the field of acupuncture research, the topic of acupoint specificity has received increasing attention, but no unified conclusion has been reached on whether or not acupoint specificity exists. Furthermore, the majority of previous acupuncture neuroimaging studies have been performed using healthy subjects. In this study, patients with migraine were used to investigate acupoint specificity.METHODS: Thirty patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into three groups: Traditional Acupuncture Group (TAG), Control Acupuncture Group (CAG), and Migraine Group (MG). The TAG was treated by acupuncture stimulation at Waiguan (TE5), Yang Lingquan (GB34), and Fengchi (GB20). The CAG was treated at Touwei (ST8), Pianli (LI6), and Zusanli (ST36). The MG received no treatment. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) was used to test for differences in brain activation between the TAG and CAG versus MG, respectively.RESULTS: Traditional acupuncture treatment was more effective for pain reduction than control acupuncture treatment. The TAG showed higher brain metabolism than the MG in the middle temporal cortex (MTC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), insula, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, post-cingulate cortex (PCC), the precuneus, and the middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Metabolism decreased in the parahippocampus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum in the TAG compared with the MG. In the CAG, metabolism increased compared with the MG in the MTC, supratemporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and MCC, whereas metabolism decreased in the cerebellum.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture stimulation of different points on similar body regions in migraine patients reduced pain and induced different levels of cerebral glucose metabolism in pain-related brain regions. These findings may support the functional specificity of migraine- treatment-related acupoint.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The number of our clinical trial registration is: ChiCTR-TRC-11001813, and the protocol and inclusion criteria have already been registered as ChiCTR-TRC-11001813.","Yang J, Zeng F, Feng Y, Fang L, Qin W, Liu X, Song W, Xie H, Chen J, Liang F",BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Aug 15;12:123. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-123.,A PET-CT study on the specificity of acupoints through acupuncture treatment in migraine patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894176
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: The study objective was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on cerebrovascular response in migraineurs by transcranial Doppler ultrasound.DESIGN: This study was a randomized, quasi double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.SUBJECTS: Thirty-five (35) migraineurs were diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria. The stimulus paradigm was performed in 18 verum and 17 placebo acupuncture patients.INTERVENTIONS: Participants were treated with acupuncture according to Traditional Chinese Medicine recommendations. All patients received one session of acupuncture each week for 8 weeks.OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture treatment, headache frequency and intensity was monitored by a headache diary. Cerebral blood flow velocity data were analyzed with a validated technique based on automated stimulus-related averaging. Vasotonus was determined by systolic and mean flow velocities and pulsality index in right and left middle cerebral arteries during rest. Cerebrovascular response was evaluated by detecting the cerebrovascular Valsalva ratio by maximum end-diastolic flow velocity acceleration during the straining phase of a Valsalva maneuver. Additionally, the centroperipheral Valsalva ratio was determined by the quotient of the cerebrovascular ratio to the corresponding blood pressure acceleration.RESULTS: Pre-/post-acupuncture treatment comparisons between verum- and placebo- acupuncture groups demonstrated a significant decrease of days with migraine headache in the verum group (-52.5%; p<0.001), whereas placebo-acupuncture patients profited to a smaller extent and the duration of headache attack (hours/month) did not decrease significantly. Pretreatment recordings showed increased vasotonus and exaggerated cerebrovascular response in migraineurs. Pre-/post-treatment comparisons demonstrated no significant differences in vasotonus between groups, while cerebrovascular response patterns to Valsalva stimulus were significantly (p<0.001) diminished in verum-acupuncture patients, but not in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that prophylactic treatment of migraineurs by standardized acupuncture might positively influence the dysfunction of the cerebrovascular response to autonomic stimuli, but not the cerebral vasotonus during rest.","Wallasch TM, Weinschuetz T, Mueller B, Kropp P",J Altern Complement Med. 2012 Aug;18(8):777-83. doi: 10.1089/acm.2011.0308.,Cerebrovascular response in migraineurs during prophylactic treatment with acupuncture: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22888768
"AbstractPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The efficacy of some nonpharmacologic therapies appears to approach that of most drugs used for the prevention of migraine and tension-type headaches. These therapies often carry a very low risk of serious side effects and frequently are much less expensive than pharmacologic therapies. Considering this combination of efficacy, minimal side effects, and cost savings, medications should generally not be prescribed alone but rather in combination with nonpharmacologic therapies.RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to the established nonpharmacologic therapies, such as biofeedback, relaxation training, butterbur, riboflavin, magnesium, and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation, recent data provide support for the use of aerobic exercise and acupuncture. Discovery of the high incidence of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, MTHFR, and attendant elevation of homocysteine levels in patients with migraine with aura led to a trial of cyanocobalamin, folate, and pyridoxine in these patients. This trial showed that taking these three supplements resulted in a reduction of homocysteine levels and improvement of migraines.SUMMARY: Therapies proven (to various degrees) to be effective for migraine include aerobic exercise; biofeedback; other forms of relaxation training; cognitive therapies; acupuncture; and supplementation with magnesium, CoQ10, riboflavin, butterbur, feverfew, and cyanocobalamin with folate and pyridoxine.",Mauskop A,Continuum (Minneap Minn). 2012 Aug;18(4):796-806. doi: 10.1212/01.CON.0000418643.24408.40.,"Nonmedication, alternative, and complementary treatments for migraine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22868542
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The economic burden that chronic pain conditions impose on individuals and society is significant. Acupuncture appears to be a clinically effective treatment for some chronic pain conditions. Given the need for policy decisions to be informed by economic evaluations, the objective of this systematic review was to synthesise data from economic evaluations to determine whether acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain conditions is good value for money.METHODS: A literature search was conducted using health and economics databases, with additional hand-searching. Economic evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials were eligible.RESULTS: Eight economic evaluations were included in this review, seven cost-utility analyses and one cost-effectiveness analysis. Conditions treated included low back pain, neck pain, dysmenorrhoea, migraine and headache, and osteoarthritis. From the seven cost-utility analyses, acupuncture was found to be clinically effective but cost more. The cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained ranged from £2527 to £14,976 per QALY, below the commonly quoted threshold used by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of £20,000 to £30,000. The one cost-effectiveness study indicated that there might be both clinical benefits and cost savings associated with acupuncture for migraine. There was heterogeneity across the eight trials in terms of professional who provided the acupuncture, style of acupuncture, and country of origin.CONCLUSION: The cost per QALY gained in all seven cost-utility studies was found to be below typical thresholds of willingness to pay.

"AbstractThrough the examples of explanatory and pragmatic trials on acupuncture for migraine and the comparison between research objectives, experiment environment and trial designs, the design of current clinical trial should focus on: (1) Making a point of continuum research on efficacy-effectiveness at trial design type; (2) Thinking highly of therapeutic effect criteria that could have a better show of trial purpose; (3) More use of qualitative research embedded in the randomized controlled trials. With these improvements, the effects of acupuncture could be evaluated more scientifically, objectively and comprehensively.","Deng ZQ, Zhou SY, Li Y, Zhao L",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2012 Jun;32(6):559-62.,[Thinking on the design scheme of clinical trial with the example of migraine treated by acupuncture].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22741270
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect and mechanism of migraine treated with pine needle moxibustion.METHODS: Forty-three patients were randomly divided into 2 groups of pine needle moxibustion group (group A, 21 cases) and medicated thread moxibustion of Zhuang medicine group (group B, 22 cases). Same acu-points were selected as the main points for both groups, namely Fengchi (GB 20), Baihui (GV 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Shuaigu (GB 8), Cuanzhu (BL 2), Sizhukong (TE 23), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Waiguan (TE 5) and Ashi points. Pine needle moxibustion was applied for the group A. Processed lighted pine needles were banded together with one even head to do moxibustion on acupoints or pain points. While, lighted medicated thread was adopted for the group B to do moxibustion. Therapeutic effects, the content of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Mg2+ in the serum and the degree of pain of the two groups were compared.RESULTS: (1) In the group A, the complete remission rate was 47.6% (10/21) and the effective rate was 90.5% (19/21). In the group B, the complete remission rate was 13.6% (3/22) and the effective rate was 50.0% (11/22).

"AbstractBACKGROUND: To evaluate different types of acupuncture treatment for migraine in China from the perspective of health economics, particularly the comparison between treatment of specific acupoints in Shaoyang meridians and penetrating sham acupoints treatment.METHODS: Data were obtained from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine. Four-hundred eighty migraineurs were randomly assigned to 3 arms of treatment with genuine acupoints and 1 arm of penetrating sham acupoints. The primary outcome measurement was the cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E), expressed as cost per 1 day reduction of headache days from baseline to week 16. Cost-comparison analyses, differences in the migraine-specific quality of life questionnaire (MSQ), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were taken as secondary outcome measurements. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted.RESULTS: The total cost per patient was ¥1273.2 (95% CI 1171.3-1375.1) in the Shaoyang specific group, ¥1427.7 (95% CI 1311.8-1543.6) in the Shaoyang non-specific group, ¥1490.8 (95% CI 1327.1-1654.6) in the Yangming specific group, and ¥1470.1 (95% CI 1358.8-1581.3) in the sham acupuncture group. The reduced days with migraine were 3.972 ± 2.7, 3.555 ± 2.8, 3.793 ± 3.6, and 2.155 ± 3.7 in these 4 groups (P < 0.05 for each genuine acupoints group vs the sham group), respectively, at week 16. The C/Es of the 4 groups were 320.5, 401.6, 393.1, and 682.2, respectively. Results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with that of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The Shaoyang specific group significantly improved in all 3 MSQ domains compared with the sham acupuncture group.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of specific acupoints in Shaoyang meridians is more cost-effective than that of non-acupoints, representing a dramatic improvement in the quality of life of people with migraine and a significant reduction in cost.

"AbstractMigraine is a disabling neurological disorder, aggravated by accompanying symptomatology, such as nausea. One of the most interesting approaches to nausea adopted by traditional Chinese medicine is the stimulation of the acupoint PC6 Neiguan. Actually there are no studies in medical literature as to the efficacy of treating PC6 acupoint for gastrointestinal symptoms in migraine attacks. Our study aimed at verifying if pressure applied to the acupoint PC6 was effective on nausea during migraine. Forty female patients suffering from migraine without aura were enrolled, if nausea was always present as accompanying symptomatology of their migraine. The patients were treated randomly for a total of six migraine attacks: three with the application of a device, the Sea-Band(®) wristband, which applies continual pressure to the PC6 acupoint (phase SB), and three without it (phase C). The intensities of nausea at the onset, at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min were evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10. The values were always significantly lower in phase SB than in phase C. Also the number of patients who reported at least a 50 % reduction in the nausea score was significantly higher in phase SB than in phase C at 30, 60 and 120 min. Moreover, the consistency of the treatment (response in at least two out of three treated attacks) was reached in 28 % patients at 60 min; in 40 % at 120 min and 59 % at 240 min. Our results encourage the application of PC6 acupressure for the treatment of migraine-associated nausea.","Allais G, Rolando S, Castagnoli Gabellari I, Burzio C, Airola G, Borgogno P, Schiapparelli P, Allais R, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2012 May;33 Suppl 1:S207-10. doi: 10.1007/s10072-012-1069-y.,Acupressure in the control of migraine-associated nausea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22644205
"AbstractBACKGROUND: One of the basic and important principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is syndrome differentiation, which is widely utilized for individual diagnosis and in the application of acupuncture treatment. However, the impact of syndrome differentiation on therapeutic effect is unclear because of insufficient supportive clinical evidence.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze current Cochrane Database systematic reviews of acupuncture and to evaluate differences in therapeutic effects of acupuncture treatment when syndrome differentiation is utilized, compared to when this approach is not utilized.METHODS: Cochrane Database systematic reviews of acupuncture were included if the reviews had sufficient data to perform subgroup analyses by syndrome differentiation applied during acupoints' selection. Searching was conducted across all available articles of the Cochrane Library, and the search concluded in July 2011.RESULTS: Forty-four trials from five Cochrane reviews were included in 10 subgroup meta-analyses. Seven meta-analyses showed that there were no differences between trials using fixed acupoints prescriptions and trials using individualized treatment based on relevant symptom improvements in cases of acute stroke, depression, epilepsy, migraine, and peripheral joint osteoarthritis (OA). The remaining 3 meta-analyses showed that acupuncture with fixed prescriptions was superior to individualized acupuncture for pain relief of peripheral joint OA, compared to sham control.CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence showed no significant difference between acupuncture treatment with or without syndrome differentiation. Large, well-designed trials are warranted to address the use of syndrome differentiation for specific diseases or conditions in order to confirm if there are any advantages of using syndrome differentiation to achieve better therapeutic effects with acupuncture.","Cao H, Bourchier S, Liu J",Med Acupunct. 2012 Jun;24(2):68-76.,Does Syndrome Differentiation Matter?

"AbstractBACKGROUND: The interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased during the past decade and the attitude of the general public is mainly positive, but the debate about the clinical effectiveness of these therapies remains controversial among many medical professionals.METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the existing literature utilizing different databases, including PubMed/Medline, PSYNDEX, and PsycLit, to research the use and acceptance of CAM among the general population and medical personnel. A special focus on CAM-referring literature was set by limiting the PubMed search to ""Complementary Medicine"" and adding two other search engines: CAMbase (www.cambase.de) and CAMRESEARCH (www.camresearch.net). These engines were used to reveal publications that at the time of the review were not indexed in PubMed.RESULTS: A total of 16 papers met the scope criteria. Prevalence rates of CAM in each of the included studies were between 5% and 74.8%. We found a higher utilization of homeopathy and acupuncture in German-speaking countries. Excluding any form of spiritual prayer, the data demonstrate that chiropractic manipulation, herbal medicine, massage, and homeopathy were the therapies most commonly used by the general population. We identified sex, age, and education as predictors of CAM utilization: More users were women, middle aged, and more educated. The ailments most often associated with CAM utilization included back pain or pathology, depression, insomnia, severe headache or migraine, and stomach or intestinal illnesses. Medical students were the most critical toward CAM. Compared to students of other professions (ie, nursing students: 44.7%, pharmacy students: 18.2%), medical students reported the least consultation with a CAM practitioner (10%).CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate an increase of CAM usage from 1990 through 2006 in all countries investigated. We found geographical differences, as well as differences between the general population and medical personnel.","Frass M, Strassl RP, Friehs H, Müllner M, Kundi M, Kaye AD",Ochsner J. 2012 Spring;12(1):45-56.,Use and acceptance of complementary and alternative medicine among the general population and medical personnel: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438782
"AbstractWe present a theory according which a headache treatment acts through a specific biological effect (when it exists), a placebo effect linked to both expectancy and repetition of its administration (conditioning), and a non-specific psychological effect. The respective part of these components varies with the treatments and the clinical situations. During antiquity, suggestions and beliefs were the mainstays of headache treatment. The word placebo appeared at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Controversies about its effect came from an excessive interpretation due to methodological bias, inadequate consideration of the variation of the measure (regression to the mean) and of the natural course of the disease. Several powerful studies on placebo effect showed that the nature of the treatment, the associated announce, the patients' expectancy, and the repetition of the procedures are of paramount importance. The placebo expectancy is associated with an activation of pre-frontal, anterior cingular, accumbens, and periacqueducal grey opioidergic neurons possibly triggered by the dopaminergic meso-limbic system. In randomized control trials, several arms design could theoretically give information concerning the respective part of the different component of the outcome and control the natural course of the disease. However, for migraine and tension type headache attacks treatment, no three arm (verum, placebo, and natural course) trial is available in the literature. Indirect evidence of a placebo effect in migraine attack treatment, comes from the high amplitude of the improvement observed in the placebo arms (28% of the patients). This figure is lower (6%) when using the harder criterium of pain free at 2 h. But these data disregard the effect of the natural course. For prophylactic treatment with oral medication, the trials performed in the last decades report an improvement in 21% of the patients in the placebo arms. However, in these studies the duration of administration was limited, the control of attacks uncertain as well as the evolution of the co-morbid psycho-pathology. Considering the reviews and meta-analysis of complex prophylactic procedures, it must be concluded that their effect is mostly linked to a placebo and non-specific psychological effects. Acupuncture may have a slight specific effect on tension type headache, but not on migraine. Manual therapy studies do not exhibit difference between manipulation, mobilization, and controls; touch has no proven specific effect. A comprehensive efficacy review of biofeedback studies concludes to a small specific effect on tension type headache but not on migraine. A review of behavioral treatment conclude to an interesting mean improvement but did not demonstrated a specific effect with the exception of a four arm study including a pseudo meditation control group. Expectation-linked placebo, conditioning, and non-specific psychological effects vary according clinical situations and psychological context; likely low in RCT, high after anempathic medical contact, and at its maximum with a desired charismatic healer. The announcements of doctors strongly influence the beliefs of patients, and in consequence their pain and anxiety sensibilities; this modulates the amplitude of the placebo and the non-specific psychological effects and is therefore a major determinant of the therapeutic success. Furthermore, any repetitive contact, even through a placebo, may interfere positively with the psychopathological co-morbidity. One has to keep in mind that the non-specific psychological interactions play a major role in the improvement of the majority of the headache sufferers.","Autret A, Valade D, Debiais S",J Headache Pain. 2012 Apr;13(3):191-8. doi: 10.1007/s10194-012-0422-0.

"AbstractLarge randomized controlled trials have shown the effectiveness of acupuncture in comparison to various control treatments for low back pain, osteoarthrosis, shoulder pain, tension type headache, and migraine. For most of these diseases the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture has been proven. A few smaller controlled trials exist for tennis elbow and osteoarthrosis of the hip. The use of acupuncture for other locomotive disorders is based on textbook literature and expert opinion. Current data show that acupuncture is a relatively safe method. Internationally several guidelines for chronic low back pain have integrated acupuncture. In Germany acupuncture has been reimbursed by the state insurance system for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis since 2007 and the estimated costs are between EUR 300-700 million annually.

"AbstractBackground There is relatively limited knowledge about the practitioners who provide acupuncture treatment within the UK, what conditions patients consult for and the treatment provided. Objectives To characterise the conditions treated and by whom, to examine characteristics of the treatment and to explore trends over time. Method A cross-sectional survey of the UK acupuncture practitioners was conducted; 800 practitioners were selected by computer-generated randomisation sequences from the four major UK-based professional associations. Data collected on the practitioners included demographic details, association membership, statutorily regulated status, practice setting, style of acupuncture, diagnostic methods and needle response sought. Practitioners recorded details of their 10 most recent patients, including demographic details, primary reason for consulting and lifestyle advice provided. Results 330 practitioners responded comprising doctors (29%) physiotherapists (29%), nurses (15%) and independent acupuncturists (27%): 62% were women with median age of 48 years. The majority (68%) practiced in independent settings and 42% practiced within the National Health Service. Patients most commonly consulted for low back, neck, shoulder and knee pain, as well as headaches and migraine. Treatment for infertility by independent acupuncturists was found to have increased fivefold in 10 years. Conclusion Acupuncture provides a substantial contribution to the healthcare of the UK, with an estimated 4 million sessions provided annually. The primary complaints for which patients consult reflect the growing evidence base on acupuncture for these conditions. These data provide a basis for decision-making regarding policy and practice.","Hopton AK, Curnoe S, Kanaan M, Macpherson H",BMJ Open. 2012 Jan 11;2(1):e000456. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000456.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine. We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture.METHODS: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life.RESULTS: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p < 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011).

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Pain is the most common reason that patients present to an emergency department (ED) and is often inadequately managed. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective for pain relief, yet it is rarely practiced in the ED. The current study aims to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for providing effective analgesia to patients presenting with acute low back pain, migraine and ankle sprain at the EDs of four hospitals in Melbourne, Australia.METHOD: The study is a multi-site, randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial of acupuncture analgesia in patients who present to an ED with low back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. Patients will be block randomized to receive either acupuncture alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone. Acupuncture will be applied according to Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). Pain after one hour, measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS), is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes measures include the following instruments; the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire, 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life questionnaire and Patient's Global Assessment of Ankle Injury Scale. These measures will be recorded at baseline, 1 hour after intervention, each hour until discharge and 48±12 hours of ED discharge. Data will also be collected on the safety and acceptability of acupuncture and health resource utilization.DISCUSSION: The results of this study will determine if acupuncture, alone or as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy provides effective, safe and acceptable pain relief for patients presenting to EDs with acute back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. The results will also identify the impact that acupuncture treatment may have upon health resource utilisation in the ED setting.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12609000989246.","Cohen M, Parker S, Taylor D, Smit de V, Ben-Meir M, Cameron P, Xue C",Trials. 2011 Nov 15;12:241. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-12-241.,"Acupuncture as analgesia for low back pain, ankle sprain and migraine in emergency departments: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085683
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of acupuncture compared with topiramate treatment in chronic migraine (CM) prophylaxis.METHODS: A total of 66 consecutive and prospective CM patients were randomly divided into two treatment arms: 1) acupuncture group: acupuncture administered in 24 sessions over 12 weeks (n = 33); and 2) topiramate group: a 4-week titration, initiated at 25 mg/day and increased by 25 mg/day weekly to a maximum of 100 mg/day followed by an 8-week maintenance period (n = 33).RESULTS: A significantly larger decrease in the mean monthly number of moderate/severe headache days (primary end point) from 20.2 ± 1.5 days to 9.8 ± 2.8 days was observed in the acupuncture group compared with 19.8 ± 1.7 days to 12.0 ± 4.1 days in the topiramate group (p < .01) Significant differences favoring acupuncture were also observed for all secondary efficacy variables. These significant differences still existed when we focused on those patients who were overusing acute medication. Adverse events occurred in 6% of acupuncture group and 66% of topiramate group.CONCLUSION: We suggest that acupuncture could be considered a treatment option for CM patients willing to undergo this prophylactic treatment, even for those patients with medication overuse.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01096420.","Yang CP, Chang MH, Liu PE, Li TC, Hsieh CL, Hwang KL, Chang HH",Cephalalgia. 2011 Nov;31(15):1510-21. doi: 10.1177/0333102411420585.

"AbstractPrimary chronic headaches cause more disability and necessitate high utilisation of health care. Our knowledge is based on selected populations, while information from the general population is largely lacking. An age and gender-stratified cross-sectional epidemiological survey included 30,000 persons aged 30-44 years. Respondents with self-reported chronic headache were interviewed by physicians. The International Classification of Headache Disorders was used. Of all primary chronic headache sufferers, 80% had consulted their general practitioner (GP), of these 19% had also consulted a neurologist and 4% had been hospitalised. Co-occurrence of migraine increased the probability of contact with a physician. A high Severity of Dependence Scale score increased the probability for contact with a physician. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was used by 62%, most often physiotherapy, acupuncture and chiropractic. Contact with a physician increased the probability of use of CAM. Acute headache medications were taken by 87%, while only 3% used prophylactic medication. GPs manage the majority of those with primary chronic headache, 1/5 never consults a physician for their headache, while approximately 1/5 is referred to a neurologist or hospitalised. Acute headache medication was frequently overused, while prophylactic medication was rarely used. Thus, avoidance of acute headache medication overuse and increased use of prophylactic medication may improve the management of primary chronic headaches in the future.","Kristoffersen ES, Grande RB, Aaseth K, Lundqvist C, Russell MB",J Headache Pain. 2012 Mar;13(2):113-20. doi: 10.1007/s10194-011-0391-8.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy for aura-absence migraine.METHODS: A total of 60 aura-absence migraine outpatients who signed an informed consent participated in the present study. They were randomized into medication group and acupuncture group (n = 30/group) according to a randomized number table and their visiting sequence. Patients of acupuncture group were treated by acupuncture of Ashi-point, Baihui (GV 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20), Benshen (GB 13) and Lieque (LU 7). The acupuncture needles were retained for 30 min after ""Deqi"", and the treatment was conducted once daily, 6 times every week and continuously for 4 weeks. Patients of the medication group were treated with oral administration of Flunarizine (10 mg/time, once every night) for 4 weeks. The SF-36 Quality-of-Life Instrument (SF-36) and integral scores of headache were measured before and after the treatment.RESULTS: In comparison with the pre-treatment, scores of physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), vitality (VT), mental-health (MH) and general health (GH) of SF-36 in both medication and acupuncture groups were increased significantly (P < 0.05), and those of PF, RP and BP of the acupuncture group were significantly higher than the scores of the medication group (P < 0.05). The integral scores of headache were decreased significantly in both medication group and acupuncture group (P < 0.05), and those of the acupuncture group were remarkably lower than the scores of the medication group after the treatment (P < 0.05). Of the two 30 migraine patients in the medication and acupuncture groups, 1 (3.33%) and 9 (30.00%) were cured, 1 (3.33%) and 2 (6.67%) had a marked improvement in their symptoms, 9 (30.00%) and 8 (26.67%) were effective, 19 (63. 33%) and 11 (36.67%) were ineffective, with the total effective rates being 36.67% and 63.33%, respectively.

"AbstractInsufficient clinical trial data were available to prove the efficacy of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis. A multicenter, double-dummy, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at the outpatient departments of acupuncture at 5 hospitals in China to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture. A total of 140 patients with migraine without aura were recruited and assigned randomly to 2 different groups: the acupuncture group treated with verum acupuncture plus placebo and the control group treated with sham acupuncture plus flunarizine. Treated by acupuncture 3 times per week and drugs every night, patients from both groups were evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 4, and week 16. The primary outcome was measured by the proportion of responders (defined as the proportion of patients with a reduction of migraine days by at least 50%). The secondary outcome measures included the number of migraine days, visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 10 cm) for pain, as well as the physical and mental component summary scores of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). The patients in the acupuncture group had better responder rates and fewer migraine days compared with the control group (P<.05), whereas there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in VAS scores and SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores (P>.05). The results suggested that acupuncture was more effective than flunarizine in decreasing days of migraine attacks, whereas no significantly differences were found between acupuncture and flunarizine in reduction of pain intensity and improvement of the quality of life.","Wang LP, Zhang XZ, Guo J, Liu HL, Zhang Y, Liu CZ, Yi JH, Wang LP, Zhao JP, Li SS",Pain. 2011 Aug;152(8):1864-71. doi: 10.1016/j.pain.2011.04.006.

"AbstractThis paper describes the diagnostic features, treatment, and subsequent clinical course of a 53-year-old male whose migraine headaches increasingly impaired his ability to master his professional daily routine, causing him to seek help at our clinic. After the patient was evaluated according to diagnosis principles of Traditional European, Traditional Indian, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, he received naturopathic treatment as recommended by these traditional medical systems, initially as an outpatient and later as an inpatient. The patient's clinical response to the various therapeutic approaches was largely favorable and continues to be so. This supports the usefulness of such methods in treating migraine headache. The philosophies and rationales of the diagnostic and treatment methods of the three traditional medical systems are discussed with regard to migraine headache, particularly with regard to migraine illness as suffered by our patient.","Wilson E, Rampp T, Wen M, Musial F, Dobos GJ",Forsch Komplementmed. 2011;18(2):84-90. doi: 10.1159/000324853.

"AbstractEar acupuncture can be a useful mean for controlling migraine pain. It has been shown that a technique called the Needle Contact Test (NCT) can identify the most efficacious ear acupoints for reducing current migraine pain through just a few seconds of needle contact. The majority of the points were located on the antero-internal part of the antitragus (area M) on the same side of pain. The aim of this study was to verify the therapeutic value of area M and to compare it with an area of the ear (representation of the sciatic nerve, area S) which probably does not have a therapeutic effect on migraine attacks. We studied 94 females suffering from migraine without aura, diagnosed according to the ICHD-II criteria, during the attack. They were randomly subdivided into two groups: in group A, tender points located in area M, positive to NCT were inserted; in group B, the unsuitable area (S) was treated. Changes in pain intensity were measured using a VAS scale at various times of the study. During treatment, there was a highly significant trend in the reduction of the VAS value in group A (Anova for repeated measures: p < 0.001), whereas no significance was observed in group B. VAS values were significantly lower in group A than in group B at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after needle insertion. This study suggests that the therapeutic specificity of auricular points exists and is linked to the somatotopic representation of our body on the ear.","Allais G, Romoli M, Rolando S, Airola G, Castagnoli Gabellari I, Allais R, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2011 May;32 Suppl 1:S173-5. doi: 10.1007/s10072-011-0525-4.,Ear acupuncture in the treatment of migraine attacks: a randomized trial on the efficacy of appropriate versus inappropriate acupoints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533739
"AbstractAcupuncture has a long tradition of use for the treatment of many pain conditions, including headache. Its effectiveness has been studied mainly for primary headaches, particularly for migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has two diagnostic frameworks for headaches: meridian diagnoses, based on the location of the pain and on the meridians (or channels) that pass through it; syndrome diagnoses, dependent on external or internal factors and on the characteristics of the pain. The four meridians involved in headache are Shaoyang (TE-GB channels, on the temporal sides of the head); Taiyang (SI-BL channels, occiput); Yangming (LI-ST channels, forehead) and Jueyin (PC-LR channels, vertex). The syndromes may be due to excess or deficit. Very generally, the excess syndromes correspond in the majority of cases to migraine and the deficit syndromes to TTH. Acupuncture is a complex intervention, which is also characterized by a close interaction between patient and therapist. The complicated system of TCM classification of headaches has frequently generated great diversity among the various therapeutic approaches used in the different studies on acupuncture in headache treatment. Despite these differences, the recent Cochrane systematic reviews on acupuncture in migraine and in TTH suggest that acupuncture is an effective and valuable option for patients suffering from migraine or frequent TTH. Moreover, acupuncture seems to be a cost-effective treatment.","Schiapparelli P, Allais G, Rolando S, Airola G, Borgogno P, Terzi MG, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2011 May;32 Suppl 1:S15-8. doi: 10.1007/s10072-011-0548-x.,Acupuncture in primary headache treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533705
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The HTA-report (Health Technology Assessment) deals with over- and undertreatment of pain therapy. Especially in Germany chronic pain is a common reason for the loss of working hours and early retirement. In addition to a reduction in quality of life for the affected persons, chronic pain is therefore also an enormous economic burden for society.OBJECTIVES: Which diseases are in particular relevant regarding pain therapy?What is the social-medical care situation regarding pain facilities in Germany?What is the social-medical care situation in pain therapy when comparing on international level?Which effects, costs or cost-effects can be seen on the micro-, meso- and macro level with regard to pain therapy?Among which social-medical services in pain therapy is there is an over- or undertreatment with regard to the micro-, meso- and macro level?Which medical and organisational aspects that have an effect on the costs and/or cost-effectiveness have to be particularly taken into account with regard to pain treatment/chronic pain?What is the influence of the individual patient's needs (micro level) in different situations of pain (e. g. palliative situation) on the meso- and macro level?Which social-medical and ethical aspects for an adequate treatment of chronic pain on each level have to be specially taken into account?Is the consideration of these aspects appropriate to avoid over- or undertreatment?Are juridical questions included in every day care of chronic pain patients, mainly in palliative care?On which level can appropriate interventions prevent over- or undertreatment?METHODS: A systematic literature research is done in 35 databases. In the HTA, reviews, epidemiological and clinical studies and economic evaluations are included which report about pain therapy and in particular palliative care in the years 2005 till 2010.RESULTS: 47 studies meet the inclusion criteria. An undertreatment of acupuncture, over- and misuse with regard to opiate prescription and an overuse regarding unspecific chest pain and chronic low back pain (LBP) can be observed. The results show the benefit and the cost-effectiveness of interdisciplinary as well as multi-professional approaches, multimodal pain therapy and cross-sectoral integrated medical care. Only rough values can be determined about the care situation regarding the supply of pain therapeutic and palliative medical facilities as the data are completely insufficient.DISCUSSION: Due to the broad research question the HTA-report contains inevitably different outcomes and study designs which partially differ qualitatively very strong from each other. In the field of palliative care hospices for in-patients and palliative wards as well as hospices for out-patients are becoming more and more important. Palliative care is a basic right of all terminally ill persons.CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively high number of studies in Germany the HTA-report shows a massive lack in health care research. Based on the studies a further expansion of out-patient pain and palliative care is recommended. Further training for all involved professional groups must be improved. An independent empirical analysis is necessary to determine over or undertreatment in pain care.","Dietl M, Korczak D",GMS Health Technol Assess. 2011 Apr 19;7:Doc03. doi: 10.3205/hta000094.,"Over-, under- and misuse of pain treatment in Germany.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21522485
"AbstractTraditional acupuncture (TA) and ear acupuncture (EA) are used for treatment of headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain. The purpose of this study is to develop effective treatment using combined acupuncture (CA) which consists of TA and EA and to set clinical protocols for future trials. Participants were divided into TA (n = 15) control and CA (n = 34) experimental groups. Obligatory points among Korean Five Element Acupuncture and optional individual points along with symptom points were used in the TA group. The CA group was exposed to ear points of Fossion and TA. Acupuncture treatment consisted of six mandatory sessions per patient over 3 weeks and extended to 12 sessions. Pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale. We compared TA to CA and researched their relevant publications. No significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.968) which showed pain-alleviating tendency. Pain alleviation was significantly different after the fifth and sixth sessions (p = 0.021, p = 0.025), with headache being the most significantly relieved (F = 4.399, p = 0.018) among the diseases. When assessing pain intensity, both the Headache Impact Test and the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale should be adopted for headache and the fractal electroencephalography method be used in pain diseases. In the future, studies should consist of TA, EA, and CA groups; each group having 20 patients. Treatment number should to be no less than 10 sessions. Korean Five Element Acupuncture should be a compulsory inclusion along with individual points being optional inclusion in TA. EA could be selected from Nogier, Fossion and so forth. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment, whether TA or CA, showed pain alleviation in headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain, but no significant difference was seen between groups. Prospective, well-controlled, and relevant protocols using multimodal strategies to define the role of TA, EA, and CA are needed.","Ahn CB, Lee SJ, Lee JC, Fossion JP, Sant'Ana A",J Acupunct Meridian Stud. 2011 Mar;4(1):29-43. doi: 10.1016/S2005-2901(11)60005-8.,"A clinical pilot study comparing traditional acupuncture to combined acupuncture for treating headache, trigeminal neuralgia and retro-auricular pain in facial palsy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440878
"AbstractBACKGROUND: In order to evaluate the safety of acupuncture in China objectively, we investigated the adverse events associated with acupuncture based on three multicentre randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety of acupuncture, identifying the common types of acupuncture adverse events, and analysing the related risk factors for their occurrence.METHODS: This observational study included patients who received acupuncture from three multicentre RCTs respectively for migraine, functional dyspepsia and Bell's palsy. The 1968 patients and their acupuncturists documented adverse events associated with acupuncture after treatment. We collected data about adverse events due to acupuncture treatment from their case report forms. We analysed the incidence and details of the adverse effects, and studied the risk factors for acupuncture adverse events with non-conditional logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Among the 1968 patients, 74 patients (3.76%) suffered at least one adverse event throughout the treatment period. We did not observe the occurrence of serious adverse events. 73 patients with adverse events recovered within 2 weeks through effective treatment such as physiotherapy or self-treatment. A total of 3 patients withdrew because of adverse events. There were 9 types of adverse events related to acupuncture, including subcutaneous haematoma, bleeding, skin bruising and needle site pain. Subcutaneous haematoma and haemorrhage in the needling points were the most common adverse events. Age and gender were related to the occurrence of acupuncture adverse events. The older the patients were, the higher the risk of adverse events was. In addition, male patients had slightly higher risk of an adverse event than female patients.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is a safe therapy with low risk of adverse events in clinical practice. The risk factors for adverse events (AEs) were related to the patients' gender and age and the local anatomical structure of the acupoints. AEs could be reduced and mitigated by improving the medical environment, ensuring a high technical level of the acupuncture practitioners and establishing a good relationship of mutual trust between doctor and patient.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00599586, NCT00599677, NCT00608660.","Zhao L, Zhang FW, Li Y, Wu X, Zheng H, Cheng LH, Liang FR",Trials. 2011 Mar 24;12:87. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-12-87.,Adverse events associated with acupuncture: three multicentre randomized controlled trials of 1968 cases in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435214

"AbstractThere are a variety of nonpharmacologic treatments for headache. Educating patients about headache and its management, identifying and managing triggers (via diaries), modifying lifestyles, and understanding the importance of adopting and adhering to interventions (either pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic) are relevant to all persons with headache. In addition, specific nonpharmacologic treatments can be used either alone or in conjunction with ongoing pharmacologic intervention. Strong candidates for nonpharmacologic treatment include individuals with significant headache-related disability, comorbid mood or anxiety disorders, difficulty managing stress or other triggers, medication overuse, and patients who prefer a specific treatment. Behavioral treatments (relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral therapy) possess the most evidence for successful headache management. They have a long history of randomized trials showing efficacy and are considered first-line preventive options. Among complementary and alternative treatments, recent positive findings from randomized trials using acupuncture provide evidence of its potential as a first-line intervention. Other complementary and alternative techniques do not have a consistent base of research to recommend them for headache prevention, but they may be used if the patient prefers this approach or when other first-line interventions (nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic) have not provided adequate results. Among ""natural"" treatments, both butterbur extract and vitamin B2 have shown efficacy in more than one randomized trial and are thus potentially useful first-line preventive interventions.","Nicholson RA, Buse DC, Andrasik F, Lipton RB",Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2011 Feb;13(1):28-40. doi: 10.1007/s11940-010-0102-9.,Nonpharmacologic treatments for migraine and tension-type headache: how to choose and when to use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21080124
"AbstractChronic daily headache (CDH) is a multi-faceted, often complex pain syndrome in children and adolescents. Chronic daily headache may be primary or secondary. Chronic migraine and chronic tension-type are the most frequent subtypes. Chronic daily headache is co-morbid with adverse life events, anxiety and depressive disorders, possibly with other psychiatric disorders, other pain syndromes and sleep disorders; these conditions contribute to initiating and maintaining CDH. Hence, early management of episodic headache and treatment of associated conditions are crucial to prevention. There is evidence for the benefit of psychological therapies, principally relaxation and cognitive behavioral, and promising information on acupuncture for CDH. Data on drug treatment are based primarily on open label studies. The controversies surrounding CDH are discussed and proposals for improvement presented. The multifaceted nature of CDH makes it a good candidate for a multi-axial classification system. Such an approach should facilitate biopsychosocial management and enhance consistency in clinical research.","Seshia SS, Wang SJ, Abu-Arafeh I, Hershey AD, Guidetti V, Winner P, Wöber-Bingöl C",Can J Neurol Sci. 2010 Nov;37(6):769-78.,Chronic daily headache in children and adolescents: a multi-faceted syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059537
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To select the best solution of immediate analgesia of migraine treated with acupuncture.METHODS: Taken 36 cases of migraine in attack stage as research objects, by means of orthogonal experimental design, applying the L9 (3(4)) orthogonal table, the therapeutic effect of immediate analgesia of acupuncture for migraine in attack stage was analyzed in four factors, which were effective acupoints combination, electroacupuncture therapy, auricular therapy and bloodletting therapy, and three levels of each factors. In the test procession, random approaches (stratified random and central random) and blinding experiment (the appraiser blind) were used. The time points of observation were before treatment, and 10, 20 minutes after treatment. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate therapeutic effect.RESULTS: Comparing with the headache before treatment, at the time points of 10 and 20 minutes after treatment, the best solution for headache relief was needling therapy (local and distal points and points selection according to the differentiation), auricular electroacupuncture therapy and bloodletting at Taiyang Zimai (Extra) or Taiyang (EX-HN 5)and Ashi points.CONCLUSION: In the attack stage of migraine, by the therapy combined with puncture on local and distal points and the points according to the differentiation, auricular electroacupuncture and bloodletting at Taiyang Zimai or Taiyang (EX-HN 5) and Ashi points, the favorable effects of immediate analgesia are received.","Wang QM, Wang JJ, Hu J, Jiao Y, Wu ZC, Yang JH, Liu WZ",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2010 Oct;30(10):798-801.,[Study on the best solution of immediate analgesia of acupuncture for migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058472
"AbstractProphylactic treatment constitutes an important aspect of migraine management and includes avoidance of trigger factors and life style advice followed by consideration of medications. The drugs of first choice are beta-blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, valproate and amitriptyline. Drugs of second choice with less efficacy and evidence are venlafaxine, gabapentin, naproxen, butterbur root, riboflavin and magnesium. Botulinum toxin type A has not yet been shown to be effective. The choice of prophylactic drugs would depend on efficacy, co-morbidity, side effects, availability and cost. Non-pharmacological treatments such as relaxation techniques, bio-feedback, cognitive behavioral therapy and acupuncture are supported by some evidence but require far more specialist time or technical devices. All the drugs used in migraine prophylaxis have been detected by serendipity. Drugs developed, in the future, on the basis of the current knowledge of pathophysiology will hopefully be more effective.","Shukla R, Sinh M",J Assoc Physicians India. 2010 Apr;58 Suppl:26-9.,Migraine: prophylactic treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21049704
"AbstractBACKGROUND: The purpose of clinical trials of acupuncture is to help clinicians and patients make decisions about treatment. Yet this is not straightforward: some trials report acupuncture to be superior to sham (placebo) acupuncture while others show evidence that acupuncture is superior to usual care but not sham, and still others conclude that acupuncture is no better than usual care. Meta-analyses of these trials tend to come to somewhat indeterminate conclusions. This appears to be because, until recently, acupuncture research was dominated by small trials of questionable quality. The Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration, a group of trialists, statisticians and other researchers, was established to synthesize patient-level data from several recently published large, high-quality trials.METHODS: There are three distinct phases to the Acupuncture Trialists Collaboration: a systematic review to identify eligible studies; collation and harmonization of raw data; statistical analysis. To be eligible, trials must have unambiguous allocation concealment. Eligible pain conditions are osteoarthritis; chronic headache (tension or migraine headache); shoulder pain; and non-specific back or neck pain. Once received, patient-level data will undergo quality checks and the results of prior publications will be replicated. The primary analysis will be to determine the effect size of acupuncture. Each trial will be evaluated by analysis of covariance with the principal endpoint as the dependent variable and, as covariates, the baseline score for the principal endpoint and the variables used to stratify randomization. The effect size for acupuncture from each trial--that is, the coefficient and standard error from the analysis of covariance--will then be entered into a meta-analysis. We will compute effect sizes separately for comparisons of acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and acupuncture with no acupuncture control for each pain condition. Other analyses will investigate the impact of different sham techniques, styles of acupuncture or frequency and duration of treatment sessions.DISCUSSION: Individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality trials will provide the most reliable basis for treatment decisions about acupuncture. Above all, however, we hope that our approach can serve as a model for future studies in acupuncture and other complementary therapies.","Vickers AJ, Cronin AM, Maschino AC, Lewith G, Macpherson H, Victor N, Sherman KJ, Witt C, Linde K, Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration",Trials. 2010 Sep 28;11:90. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-11-90.,Individual patient data meta-analysis of acupuncture for chronic pain: protocol of the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920180
"ExcerptOBJECTIVES: To identify and summarize evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy of behavioral and physical treatments for migraine.SEARCH STRATEGY: A strategy combining the MeSH term “headache” (exploded) and a previously published strategy for identifying randomized controlled trials was used on the January 1966 to December 1996 MEDLINE database. Other computerized bibliographic databases, textbooks, and experts were also utilized.SELECTION CRITERIA: English-language controlled trials involving patients with migraine in which at least one treatment offered was a behavioral or physical treatment were selected.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Measures of headache index and headache frequency reported as group means (and standard deviations) were used to calculate standardized mean differences (or effect sizes). Where similar trials provided data, meta-analysis of efficacy measures was performed. The number of patients obtaining at least a 50% reduction in headache index, frequency, or severity was recorded and used to calculate odds ratios.MAIN RESULTS: Behavioral treatments for migraine have a consistent body of research indicating efficacy. Summary effect sizes from a meta-analysis of 18 trials suggest that relaxation training, thermal biofeedback combined with relaxation training, electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are all modestly effective in treating migraine when compared to a wait-list control. Thermal biofeedback alone or combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy yielded similar effect sizes that failed to reach statistical significance. Physical treatments have been less often studied. Six small trials of acupuncture yielded mixed results. Other physical treatments for which controlled trials have been reported include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (2 trials), cervical mobilization and manipulation (1 trial), occlusal adjustment (1 trial), and hyperbaric oxygen (1 trial).CONCLUSIONS: Each of the behavioral therapies considered has modest efficacy for migraine. There is little information about which patients will benefit from particular behavioral approaches; the choice among them may, for the present, depend more on availability and acceptability than on data about efficacy. There are insufficient data about any of the physical treatments to draw conclusions about their efficacy.","Goslin RE, Gray RN, McCrory DC, Penzien D, Rains J, Hasselblad V",Not found,Behavioral and Physical Treatments for Migraine Headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20734517
"AbstractThe aim of this article is to present a standardized protocol of acupuncture for the management of migraine. A systematic review of available randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for migraineurs was conducted in the five following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. Information of selected acupoints and treatment course was extracted from the included trials. Then we analyzed the treatment methods used in these trials, to identify any similarities of therapeutic approaches. Additionally, quality of all the included trials was assessed. At last, the extracted information of acupuncture protocols was analyzed, and the similarities of therapeutic approaches were summed up. Bilateral use of the following points is recommended: Fengchi (GB20), Taiyang (EX-HN5), etc. De-qi sensation is requested in acupuncture manipulating procedure, and manual stimulation is suggested. The optimal treatment frequency is twice a week with one week rest between the first 10 and the last 10 sessions. Additionally, the duration of one treatment session ought to be 30 minutes, while it is recommended to use about 20 needles in one session. The total duration of an acupuncture treatment should be at least 10 weeks. The protocol analyzed from trials with positive results is different from trials with negative in number of treatment sessions. Therefore in future trials, enough acupuncture treatment sessions should be fully considered.","Zheng H, Chen M, Wu X, Li Y, Liang FR",Am J Chin Med. 2010;38(4):639-50.,Manage migraine with acupuncture: a review of acupuncture protocols in randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626050
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of acupuncture on the phosphene threshold, by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and the clinical effect of acupuncture on headache frequency, duration and severity.METHODS: Twenty-one patients (16 women; mean age 46 years; range 23-61 years, 17 Chinese, 2 Malays, 2 Indians) underwent 10 acupuncture sessions scheduled twice a week for 5 weeks. The lowest TMS intensity to elicit phosphene perception is defined as the phosphene threshold. TMS was performed before the first and last sessions, and at 2 months' follow-up.RESULTS: Acupuncture resulted in reduction of headache frequency, duration and severity over the course of treatment. However, this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the phosphene threshold over a similar time course. The baseline threshold before acupuncture treatment had no predictive value for outcome of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Although acupuncture was effective in treating migraine, the use of occipital cortex excitability as an adjunctive parameter to evaluate treatment response was not suitable. The relief of migraine with acupuncture may be related to separate neural pathways independent of occipital or visual processes in the human brain.","Lo YL, Cui SL, Lum SY, Chong SF, Siow HC",Acupunct Med. 2010 Jun;28(2):74-7. doi: 10.1136/aim.2009.002055.,A study of acupuncture in Asian patients: clinical aspects and effects on cortical excitability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20615860
"AbstractINTRODUCTION: Migraine is a serious illness that needs correct treatment for acute attacks and, in addition, a treatment prophylaxis, since patients with migraine suffer during acute attacks and also between attacks.METHODS: A systematic review of the most relevant clinical trials of migraine headache and its epidemiology, pathophysiology, comorbidity, and prophylactic treatment (medical and nonmedical) was carried out using ""Medline"" and ""PsychINFO"" from 1973 to 2009. Approximately 110 trials met our inclusion criteria and were included in the current review.RESULTS: The most effective pharmacological treatment for migraine prophylaxis is propranolol and anticonvulsants such as topiramate, valproic acid, and amitriptyline. Nonmedical treatments such as acupuncture, biofeedback, and melatonin have also been proposed. Peripheral neurostimulation has been suggested for the treatment of chronic daily headache that does not respond to prophylaxis and for the treatment of drug-resistant primary headache. The majority of the pharmacological agents available today have limited efficacy and may cause adverse effects incompatible with long-term use.LIMITATIONS: The review was limited by the highly variable and often insufficient reporting of the complex outcome data and by the fact that migraine prophylaxis trials typically use headache diaries to monitor the course of the disease. The results of the different studies were also presented in different ways, making comparison of the results difficult.DISCUSSION: An adequate prophylaxis is crucial in reducing disability and preventing the evolution of the problem into a chronic progressive illness. The implications of the present findings were discussed.","Pompili M, Serafini G, Innamorati M, Serra G, Dominici G, Fortes-Lindau J, Pastina M, Telesforo L, Lester D, Girardi P, Tatarelli R, Martelletti P",Patient Relat Outcome Meas. 2010 Jul;1:107-18. doi: 10.2147/PROM.S9742.

"AbstractStudying on the acupoints in the hairline region of the scalp, it is discovered that a group of acupoints are orderly arranged in the hairline region of the scalp. Furthermore, the arrangement is highly consistent with the meridian route of zang-fu organs. Manipulating needles at acupoints in the hairline regions of the scalp may treat certain diseases, including insomnia, migraine, and Alzheimer disease. The characteristics of the acupuncture treatment at acupoints in the hairline of scalp resemble the characteristics of ear acupuncture and eye acupuncture. Thus forms a special micro-acupuncture system in the hairline regions of the scalp.

"AbstractThe needle contact test (NCT) is a diagnostic technique useful to identify, through the contact of the needle on the skin of the ear, the most efficacious points for reducing pain during a migraine attack. The aim of this study was to identify the most important auricular zones for pain control by applying the NCT in a group of 15 women during a unilateral attack of migraine without aura. We also assessed how effective the insertion of a semi-permanent needle in these zones was in reducing the migraine pain during the next 24 h. The most effective tender points in pain control were located on the antero-internal part of the antitragus, the anterior part of the lobe and the upper auricular concha ipsilateral to the side of pain. The insertion of a semi-permanent needle in these zones allowed stable control of the migraine pain, which occurred within 30 min and persisted at the same levels 24 h later (ANOVA for repeated measures: p < 0.01). Pain was tested by using a visual analogue scale; the values recorded were the following: 7.6 +/- 1.6 at baseline and 4.3 +/- 1.7; 4.1 +/- 1.9; 3.9 +/- 1.8; 3.4 +/- 1.8; 2.3 +/- 1.6 after, respectively, 15, 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h.","Allais G, Romoli M, Rolando S, Castagnoli Gabellari I, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2010 Jun;31 Suppl 1:S185-7. doi: 10.1007/s10072-010-0323-4.,Ear acupuncture in unilateral migraine pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464619
"AbstractAcupuncture has been used to both prevent and treat diseases for over 3,000 years. Recently, a Cochrane review on its use in migraine concluded that acupuncture is effective and should be considered as a prophylactic measure for patients with frequent or insufficiently controlled migraine attacks. In contrast, there is no clear evidence to support or refute the use of homeopathy in the management of migraine. Among vitamins and other supplements, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the frequency of migraine attacks. Alpha lipoic acid also reduced migraine frequency, albeit not significantly as compared to placebo. The prophylactic efficacy of magnesium, particularly for children and menstrually related migraine, has recently been substantiated. Among the herbal remedies, butterbur significantly decreases attack frequency, whereas the efficacy of feverfew was not confirmed in a Cochrane review, probably because of the 400% variations in the dosage of its active principle. Finally, ginkgolide B has proved significantly effective in controlling migraine with aura and pediatric migraine in uncontrolled studies that need a confirmation.","Schiapparelli P, Allais G, Castagnoli Gabellari I, Rolando S, Terzi MG, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2010 Jun;31 Suppl 1:S137-9. doi: 10.1007/s10072-010-0307-4.,Non-pharmacological approach to migraine prophylaxis: part II.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464605
"AbstractMigrainous women note a significant improvement in their headaches during pregnancy. However, persistent or residual attacks need to be treated, keeping in mind that many drugs have potential dangerous effects on embryo and foetus. It is evident, therefore, that hygiene and behaviour measures capable of ensuring the best possible well-being (regular meals and balanced diet, restriction of alcohol and smoking, regular sleeping pattern, moderate physical exercise and relaxation) are advisable during pregnancy. Among non-pharmacological migraine prophylaxis only relaxation techniques, in particular biofeedback, and acupuncture have accumulated sufficient evidence in support of their efficacy and safety. Some vitamins and dietary supplements have been proposed: the prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 are probably low, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options.","Airola G, Allais G, Castagnoli Gabellari I, Rolando S, Mana O, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2010 Jun;31 Suppl 1:S63-5. doi: 10.1007/s10072-010-0276-7.,Non-pharmacological management of migraine during pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464586
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on cortical spreading depression (CSD) and contents of plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in migraine rats.METHODS: Thirty male SD rats were equally randomized into control, model and EA groups. Migraine model was established by topical application of KCI (3 mol/L) immersed in a piece of filter paper to the cerebral cortex (parietal lobe, 6 mm posterior to the Bregma and 5 mm to the sagital fissure) after exposure of the skull (in reference to Michael' method). KCI stimulation evoked CSD potentials (3 mm rostral to the Bregma, and 2 mm to the sagital fissure) were recorded by using a glass microelectrode. For rats of control group, filter paper containing 0.9% NaCl was applied to the same parietal cortex area. EA (1 mA, 2 Hz/100 Hz) was applied to bilateral ""Yanglingquan"" (GB 34) and ""Taichong"" (LR 3) for 30 min. The contents of plasma CGRP and SP were assayed by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: CSD was induced 3-5 min after application of KCI to the parietal lobe. The average amplitude of model group was (-25.13 +/- 1.23) mV, and that of EA group was (-19.19 +/- 1.53) mV, displaying a significant reduction of CSD amplitude after EA (P < 0.01). Comparison among 3 groups showed that both plasma CGRP and SP contents in model group were significantly higher than those of control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.01), while compared with model group, plasma CGRP and SP levels in EA group decreased considerably (P < 0.05, P < 0.001), suggesting an inhibitory effect of EA on pain-producing substance.CONCLUSION: EA of GB 34 and LR 3 can effectively suppress KCI provoked cortical spreading depression and plasma CGRP and SP levels in the rat, which may contribute to its effect in relieving migraine in clinic.","Shi H, Li JH, Ji CF, Shang HY, Qiu EC, Wang JJ, Jing XH",Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2010 Feb;35(1):17-21.,[Effect of electroacupuncture on cortical spreading depression and plasma CGRP and substance P contents in migraine rats].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20458901
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate changes in personal and professional use of acupuncture among physicians in Norway between 1994 and 2004.DESIGN: Postal surveys were used.SETTING: The study was conducted in Norway.SUBJECTS: Proportional, stratified, random samples of working members of the Norwegian Medical Association under 71 years of age were chosen to participate. Sampling frame, sample, and, respondents were, respectively 11,728; 1466; and 1135 (77%) in 1994 and 16,462; 1646; and 962 (58%) in 2004.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were personal and professional use of acupuncture, which were analyzed overall and separately for gender, age, and position within a year and between years by multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: The percentage of physicians having used acupuncture for own disease or complaint has more than doubled, 18% in 2004 versus 8% in 1994 (OR 2.19; p < 0.001) and half of the physicians intended to use acupuncture for own disease or complaint, 55% in 2004 and 53% in 1994 (p = 0.245).

"AbstractAcupuncture has been reported to affect the autonomic system. Currently, there are no systematic reviews examining the effect of acupuncture on HRV available in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically assess the effects of acupuncture on heart rate variability. We searched the literature using 14 databases for articles published from the earliest available publications until October 2009 without language restrictions. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture and sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Twelve RCTs met all of the inclusion criteria. One RCT evaluated the effects of acupuncture in patients with minor depression or anxiety disorders and another RCT examined the effect of acupuncture on migraine patients. Another four RCTs tested the effects of acupuncture in healthy subjects who were exposed to several conditions, including mental stress, fatigue from driving, and caffeine intake. The remaining six RCTs assessed the effects of acupuncture on healthy subjects in a normal state without any stressors. Five RCTs found significant differences in HRV between patients treated with acupuncture versus those treated with sham acupuncture (controls). However, the majority of the other RCTs showed inconsistent results or did not identify significant differences in HRV spectral parameters among individuals treated with acupuncture as compared to those treated with sham acupuncture. In conclusion, sham-controlled RCTs showed variable results and no clear evidence that acupuncture has any specific effects on HRV.

The significant role of acupuncture for prevention of migraine has not been applied in wide range in China until the present day. However, it has been paid great attention in Western countries. This situation might be related to the differences of efficacy assessment of acupuncture between China and Western countries; meanwhile, in the past traditional acupuncturists put much stress on the therapeutic approaches for acute attacks of headache but less on prevention. It is necessary for Chinese doctors to learn from research method in the West and emphasize more on acupuncture for preventing migraine and conduct high-level clinical trials as well.

"AbstractMigraine is a common and disabling brain disorder with a strong inherited component. Because patients with migraine have severe and disabling attacks usually of headache with other symptoms of sensory disturbance (eg, light and sound sensitivity), medical treatment is often required. Patients can be managed by use of acute attack therapies (eg, simple analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or specific agents with vasoconstrictor properties (ie, triptans or ergot derivatives). Future non-vasoconstrictor approaches include calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. Preventive therapy is probably indicated in about a third of patients with migraine, and a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options exist. Medication overuse is an important concern in migraine therapeutics and needs to be identified and managed. In most patients, migraine can be improved with careful attention to the details of therapy, and in those for whom it cannot, neuromodulation approaches, such as occipital nerve stimulation, are currently being actively studied and offer much promise.","Goadsby PJ, Sprenger T",Lancet Neurol. 2010 Mar;9(3):285-98. doi: 10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70005-3.,Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170842
"AbstractWith the increased incidence of migraine headaches noted in the military population it becomes imperative to find safe and effective treatment options for soldiers. Acupuncture may be one of those options. This pilot study used a standardized set of well-known acupuncture points over a predetermined time interval on 26 subjects suffering from chronic daily headache, the majority being migraineurs, and found a reduction in the frequency and intensity of their headaches. Headache calendars and validated measurements were compared 12 weeks before and 12 weeks after the acupuncture intervention. Results showed continued improvements 12 weeks after the last treatment. Traditionally, acupuncture treatments are individualized at each visit. However the absence of a standardized treatment regimen obstructs data reproducibility across the discipline. A standardized approach may be useful. Variations of these acupuncture points have been used in recent research studies for migraines and acupuncture for headaches for the past 2,000 years.","Plank S, Goodard J",Mil Med. 2009 Dec;174(12):1276-81.,The effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic daily headache: an outcomes study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20055068

"AbstractBetween 1986 and 2003, research efforts on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) were subsidized by the Dutch government. This led to 12 academic theses and a considerable number of papers in medical journals. In our review, we have summarized the results of this research, grouped by therapeutic category (that is, acupuncture, paranormal therapies, naturopathy, manual therapies, homeopathy and anthroposophical medicine.) Of the 12 theses, four were written in Dutch, three of which were not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals, while the fourth, on enzyme therapy, led to a number of papers in Dutch medical journals. In three instances, mildly positive findings were reported: on the efficacy of manual therapies, the use of acupuncture analgesia in surgery, and an elimination diet against migraine and tension headaches. These positive conclusions can easily be explained by methodological shortcomings (e.g., not using credible placebo-control groups); in the other nine theses, the researchers themselves had drawn negative conclusions.

"AbstractIn the present paper, the authors sum up the same and different view points about acupuncture treatment of migraine in the ancient and modern clinical practice, and make a detailed explanation from three aspects: 1) the therapeutic principles, handed down from the ancient times, and still surviving in clinical practice nowadays; 2) the traditional principles recorded only in the ancient literature but given up in modern treatment; and 3) the new therapeutic principles innovated in modern clinical practice. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that the modern therapeutic principles for migraine are still relatively simple in spite of having some rather strong advantages, and some important traditional therapeutic principles have been lost unfortunately. The authors strongly recommend that the migraine, a commonly seen problem in clinic, may be managed from a new angle, i.e., solving it by puncturing acupoints of both Shaoyang and Taiyang meridians on the severer side.","Hu J, Wu ZC, Wang JJ, Jiao Y",Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2009 Aug;34(4):276-8.,[Comparison between modern and ancient thoughts about acupuncture treatment of migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19916294
"AbstractAcupuncture is increasingly used as an alternative or complementary therapy for the treatment of pain. It is well tolerated, with a low risk of serious adverse effects. Traditional and modern acupuncture techniques may result in reported improvement in pain patterns. Research on acupuncture has had a number of limitations, including: incomplete understanding of the physiologic effects of acupuncture; ineffective blinding of participants; unclear adequacy of acupuncture ""dose;"" difficulty in identification of suitable sham or placebo treatments; and the use of standardized treatment regimens rather than the individualized approach that characterizes most acupuncture practice. Controlled trials have been published regarding acupuncture for lumbar, shoulder, and neck pain; headache; arthritis; fibromyalgia; temporomandibular joint pain; and other pain syndromes. Enough data are available for some conditions to allow systematic evaluations or meta-analyses. Based on published evidence, acupuncture is most likely to benefit patients with low back pain, neck pain, chronic idiopathic or tension headache, migraine, and knee osteoarthritis. Promising but less definitive data exist for shoulder pain, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular joint pain, and postoperative pain. Acupuncture has not been proven to improve pain from rheumatoid arthritis. For other pain conditions, there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions.",Kelly RB,Am Fam Physician. 2009 Sep 1;80(5):481-4.,Acupuncture for pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725489

"AbstractA growing number of clinical trials are testing Chinese acupuncture in the management of headache disorders. Little is known, however, about the relationship between International Headache Society diagnostic criteria and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis in primary headache disorders. We conducted a secondary analysis of the data of the prospective, controlled, blinded German acupuncture trials for migraine and tension-type headache. Data were collected from 1042 headache patients, of whom 633 were diagnosed with migraine and 409 with tension-type headache. We found that the diagnoses of migraine and tension-type headache were mirrored by different patterns of TCM diagnoses, with the patterns Liver Yang Rising, Liver Fire Rising, and Phlegm appearing to be best suited to differentiating between migraine and tension-type headache. Although not unexpected, given that the diagnosis of primary headache disorders in both diagnostic systems is based largely on the nature and quality of patient-reported symptoms, this finding suggests that migraine and tension-type headache are associated with different patterns of TCM diagnosis.","Böwing G, Zhou J, Endres HG, Coeytaux RR, Diener HC, Molsberger AF",Cephalalgia. 2010 Feb;30(2):224-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01921.x.,Differences in Chinese diagnoses for migraine and tension-type headache: an analysis of the German acupuncture trials (GERAC) for headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19614709

Therefore, this control method is not a proper control method of placebo acupuncture, and can not be used as the control method for sham-acupuncture (placebo acupuncture) in clinical acupuncture studies. Thus, the conclusion of ""no difference between the acupuncture and sham-acupuncture in the clinically therapeutic effects"" made by this placebo acupuncture control method naturally may be overturned.","Wang JJ, Wu ZC",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2009 Apr;29(4):315-9.,[Thinking about the conclusion of no difference between the acupuncture and sham-acupuncture in the clinically therapeutic effects on migraine abroad].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19565742
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of acupuncture at points of The Liver and Gallbladder Meridians for treatment of migraine.METHODS: Multi-central, randomized and controlled trial was used and 253 cases of migraine were divided into an acupuncture group and a western medicine group. The acupuncture group was treated with acupuncture at points of The Liver and Gallbladder Channels with Taichong (LR 3), Yang-lingquan (GB 34), Fengchi (GB 20), Ququan (LR 8) selected as main points, and the western medicine group with oral administration of Flunarizine tablets for 4 therapeutic courses. The total therapeutic effects 3 and 6 months after the treatment, the scores of various symptoms of migraine before and after treatment, and the stability of therapeutic effect in one-year following-up survey were observed in the two groups.RESULTS: After treatment, mean times and duration of the headache attack were significantly improved in the two groups (all P < 0.01) with the acupuncture group better than the western medicine group (P < 0.05). The total effective rates for stopping pain after treatment, 3 months and 6 months after treatment in the acupuncture group were 93.0%, 93.0% and 87.7%, respectively, which were better than 85.6%, 86.5% and 69.2% in the western medication group (all P < 0.01). One year later, the stability of the therapeutic effect in the acupuncture group was better than that in the western medicine group (P < 0.05); the adverse reaction and the compliance in the acupuncture group were significantly superior to those in the western medicine group.CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at points of The Liver and Gallbladder Meridians for treatment of migraine is safe, effective, and with stable long-term therapeutic effect.","Zhong GW, Li W, Luo YH, Wang SE, Wu QM, Zhou B, Chen JJ, Liu BL",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2009 Apr;29(4):259-63.,[Acupuncture at points of the liver and gallbladder meridians for treatment of migraine: a multi-center randomized and controlled study].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19565729
"AbstractA comparison of recognition to migraine and treatment methods for it was made between traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine in this paper. Emphasis was made on standardized manipulation processes and techniques of sharp hooked needling for treating the disease, based on both the organic conception of the human body, the theory held by TCM, and on the principle of treatment according to pathogenesis obtained through differentiation of symptoms and signs. The necessary preparation before operations, methods for its application and announcements in the standardized manipulations of sharp hooked needling were all explained in detail. Based on its needling, pricking, dissecting and relaxing effects, the mechanisms of sharp hooked needling in treating the disease were investigated. It is concluded that sharp hooked needling is very effective in treating migraine.","Jin CN, Zhang TS, Guan F, Ji LX, Li L, Li XH, Hao SF, Yuan Y",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2009 Jun;29(6):508-9.,[Standardized manipulations of sharp hooked needling for treating migraine and investigation on its mechanisms].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19563204
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To analyze the regularity of selection of meridians and acupoints for treating migraine in past dynasties.METHODS: The data were collected from 178 kinds of literature concerning acupuncture and moxibustion from the Pre-Qin Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, based on which bibliographic database in ancient acupuncture and moxibustion for treating migraine was established. By way of data excavation and analysis, meridians and acupoints and their combinations frequently used for the treatment in successive dynasties were screened, and the potential regularity was searched.RESULTS: In the treatment of migraine, the Gall Bladder Meridian was the meridian used most frequently, and both local and remote points in the four extremities were used. Acupoints in yang meridians, especially Fengchi (GB 20), Sizhukong (TE 23) and Shuaigu (GB 8) in Shaoyang meridians were used most frequently. In terms of classification of the special points selected, besides the Crossing Points with meridian qi passing through and crossing in the head, points below the elbow and knee joints, such as Source points, Luo Points, Eight Confluence Points, as well as Five Shu Points were also much frequently used.CONCLUSION: According to data excavation and analysis of references recorded on the treatment of migraine by acupuncture and moxibustion in past dynasties, it is concluded that meridian theories are the foundation and prerequisite for guiding clinical treatment and point selection, in which special acupoints are the main components and the core in point prescription.","Zhao L, Ren YL, Liang FR",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2009 Jun;29(6):467-72.,[Analysis of characteristics of meridians and acupoints selected for treating migraine in past dynasties based on data excavation].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19563194
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To assess the therapeutic effects on acupuncture preventive treatment of no-aura migraine and its influence on the QOL (quality of life) of the patients.METHODS: Randomized controlled, double-blind and double-dummy research methods were adopted, 60 cases were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in each group. The observation group was treated with acupuncture combined with oral administration of Flunarizine Hydrochloride vacuity capsules, and Baihui (GV 20), Shenting (GV 24) and Benshen (GB 13) were selected as main points. The control group was treated with oral administration of Flunarizine Hydrochloride capsules combined with acupuncture at placebo-points, thrice each week, for 4 weeks. The SF-36 QOL Scale and effective rate were used for assessment of therapeutic effects before treatment, after treatment and 3 months later.RESULTS: There were significant differences in each dimension scores of SF-36 at 3 time points between the two groups (all P < 0.05). The dimension of the physiological function in the observation group was superior to that of the control group after treatment (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in other 7 dimensions between the two groups (all P > 0.05). After treatment and 3 months later, the effective rates were 68.0%, 68.0% in the observation group and 24.0%, 32.0% in the control group, respectively, with significant differences between the two groups (all P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture preventive treatment can effectively improve the life quality of the patients with migraine and reduce the migraine attack. There is no significant difference in improving the physical and psychological health of the migraine patients between acupuncture and Flunarizine Hydrochloride, and acupuncture is more effective in reducing the migraine attack days.","Zhang Y, Zhang L, Li B, Wang LP",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2009 Jun;29(6):431-5.,[Effects of acupuncture preventive treatment on the quality of life in patients of no-aura migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19563186

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to investigate parental attitudes toward acupuncture for their child. No known research has explored how medical providers discuss acupuncture with families or specific concerns parents have about acupuncture. This study examined whether acupuncture attitudes were influenced by (1) the way acupuncture is explained to parents by a physician and (2) parental experience with acupuncture.DESIGN: Parents (N = 240) read vignettes that varied in a 2 (Physician Description of Acupuncture: Traditional Chinese Medicine versus biomedical) x 2 (Gender: male versus female) design and responded to questions assessing their attitudes toward acupuncture.RESULTS: A factor analysis of the vignette questions resulted in two factors: acupuncture acceptability (alpha = 0.88) and information seeking (alpha = 0.70). Previous experience with acupuncture significantly increased acupuncture acceptability and reduced interest in information seeking. Parents with experience were more likely to report wanting to pursue acupuncture for their child. A biomedical explanation led to increased acceptability and interest in pursuing information among parents with experience (d = 0.36), and significantly predicted parental agreement with the vignette item, ""I would have my child receive acupuncture treatment."" Common acupuncture concerns included fear of needles and acupuncture ineffectiveness.CONCLUSIONS: Parents' experience with acupuncture, regardless of its perceived helpfulness, appears to play an important role in their consideration of acupuncture for their child. Additional research is needed to fully understand the importance of the way acupuncture is presented to families, as it appears to impact parental attitudes in subtle ways. Parents have numerous concerns regarding acupuncture. Our findings suggest that providers would benefit from increased awareness of families' interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine so as to better monitor safety, provide advice, and discuss treatment expectations and misconceptions.","Jastrowski Mano KE, Davies WH",J Altern Complement Med. 2009 Jun;15(6):661-8. doi: 10.1089/acm.2008.0449.,Parental attitudes toward acupuncture in a community sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19489705
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To discuss the results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of verum acupuncture in treating acute migraine attacks.BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used in China for centuries to treat migraine headache. Convincing evidence of its efficacy in alleviating pain, however, has been inadequate to date.METHODS: A total of 218 patients with migraine were recruited for the study; 180 met the inclusion criteria; 175 completed the callback process and were randomized into 3 groups. One group received verum acupuncture while subjects in the other 2 groups were treated with sham acupuncture. Each patient received 1 session of treatment and was observed over a period of 24 hours. The main outcome measure was the differences in visual analog scale (VAS) scores before treatment and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after treatment.RESULTS: Significant decreases in VAS scores from baseline were observed in the fourth hour after treatment when VAS was measured in the patients who received either verum acupuncture or sham acupunctures (P < .05). The VAS scores in the fourth hour after treatment decreased by a median of 1.0 cm, 0.5 cm, and 0.1 cm in the verum acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group 1, and sham acupuncture group 2, respectively. Similarly, there was a significant difference in the change in VAS scores from baseline in the second hour after treatment among the 3 groups (P = .006). Moreover, at the second hour after treatment, only patients treated with verum acupuncture showed significant decreases in VAS scores from baseline by a median of 0.7 cm (P < .001). Significant differences were observed in pain relief, relapse, or aggravation within 24 hours after treatment as well as in the general evaluations among the 3 groups (P < .05). Most patients in the acupuncture group experienced complete pain relief (40.7%) and did not experience recurrence or intensification of pain (79.6%).CONCLUSION: Verum acupuncture treatment is more effective than sham acupuncture based on either Chinese or Western nonacupoints in reducing the discomfort of acute migraine. Verum acupuncture is also clearly effective in relieving pain and preventing migraine relapse or aggravation. These findings support the contention that there are specific physiological effects that distinguish genuine acupoints from nonacupoints.","Li Y, Liang F, Yang X, Tian X, Yan J, Sun G, Chang X, Tang Y, Ma T, Zhou L, Lan L, Yao W, Zou R",Headache. 2009 Jun;49(6):805-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01424.x.

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Many studies have already reported encouraging results in the prophylactic therapy of migraine by acupuncture, but there seems to be a lack of high quality randomized controlled trials from China. We design and perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with flunarizine in the prophylactic therapy of patients with migraine without aura in China.METHODS: This trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. The 140 migraine patients are randomly allocated to two different groups. The acupuncture groups (n = 70) is treated with acupuncture and placebo medicine; while the control group (n = 70) is treated with sham acupuncture and medicine (Flunarizine). Both Flunarizine and placebo are taken 10 mg once per night for the first 2 weeks and then 5 mg once per night for the next 2 weeks. Patients in both groups receive 12 sessions of verum/sham acupuncture in 4 weeks.DISCUSSION: The study design and the long term clinical practice of acupuncturists guarantee a high external validity for the results.

"AbstractIn October 2000 the German Federal Committee of Physicians and Health Insurers recommended that special Model Projects on Acupuncture (""Modellvorhaben Akupunktur"") be developed in order to determine the evidence-based role of acupuncture in the treatment of certain illnesses. This paper presents a summary of the main randomised controlled trials performed as part of these projects, and the associated economic analyses. Overall the results show that acupuncture is effective in practice for a range of chronic conditions, and it seems likely to have acceptable cost utility (at least at a rate of euro35 per session). Sham acupuncture, in the form of minimal off-point needling in a therapeutic context, also appears to be effective, being no different to prophylactic medication in migraine, and superior to guideline-based standard care in chronic low back pain. In patients recruited to acupuncture trials, the response to treatment does not differ between those that agree to be randomised and those that do not. This suggests that the results of the pragmatic Acupuncture in Routine Care studies are applicable to patients from the general population who express a preference for acupuncture. In conclusion, acupuncture appears to be effective in a range of chronic conditions and it seems to have acceptable cost-effectiveness in Western health economic terms. These programmes of research do not confirm the hypothesis that needling at specific points is essential to achieve satisfactory clinical effects of acupuncture. Sham acupuncture, in the form of minimal off-point needling in a therapeutic context, is unlikely to be an inactive placebo.

"AbstractPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses current data on nosological boundaries related to diagnosis, pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH).RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic criteria of CTTH should be adapted to improve its sensitivity against migraine. It seems that mechanical pain sensitivity is a consequence and not a causative factor of CTTH. Recent evidence is modifying previous knowledge about relationships between muscle tissues and CTTH, suggesting a potential role of muscle trigger points in the genesis of pain. An updated pain model suggests that headache perception can be explained by referred pain from trigger points in the craniocervical muscles, mediated through the spinal cord and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis rather than only tenderness of the muscles themselves. Different therapeutic strategies, pharmacological, physical therapy, psychological and acupuncture, are generally used. The therapeutic efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs remains incomplete. The tricyclic antidepressants are the most used first-line therapeutic agents for CTTH. Surprisingly, few controlled studies have been performed and not all of them have found an efficacy superior to placebo. Further, there is insufficient evidence to support/refute the efficacy of physical therapy in CTTH.SUMMARY: Although there is an increasing scientific interest in CTTH, future studies incorporating subgroups of patients who will likely to benefit from a specific treatment (clinical prediction rules) should be conducted.","Fernández-de-las-Peñas C, Schoenen J",Curr Opin Neurol. 2009 Jun;22(3):254-61. doi: 10.1097/WCO.0b013e32832973ce.,Chronic tension-type headache: what is new?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19300250

"AbstractPlacebo-control of acupuncture is used to evaluate and distinguish between the specific effects and the non-specific ones. During 'true' acupuncture treatment in general, the needles are inserted into acupoints and stimulated until deqi is evoked. In contrast, during placebo acupuncture, the needles are inserted into non-acupoints and/or superficially (so-called minimal acupuncture). A sham acupuncture needle with a blunt tip may be used in placebo acupuncture. Both minimal acupuncture and the placebo acupuncture with the sham acupuncture needle touching the skin would evoke activity in cutaneous afferent nerves. This afferent nerve activity has pronounced effects on the functional connectivity in the brain resulting in a 'limbic touch response'. Clinical studies showed that both acupuncture and minimal acupuncture procedures induced significant alleviation of migraine and that both procedures were equally effective. In other conditions such as low back pain and knee osteoarthritis, acupuncture was found to be more potent than minimal acupuncture and conventional non-acupuncture treatment. It is probable that the responses to 'true' acupuncture and minimal acupuncture are dependent on the aetiology of the pain. Furthermore, patients and healthy individuals may have different responses. In this paper, we argue that minimal acupuncture is not valid as an inert placebo-control despite its conceptual brilliance.","Lund I, Näslund J, Lundeberg T",Chin Med. 2009 Jan 30;4:1. doi: 10.1186/1749-8546-4-1.,Minimal acupuncture is not a valid placebo control in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture: a physiologist's perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19183454

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is often used for tension-type headache prophylaxis but its effectiveness is still controversial. This review (along with a companion review on 'Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis') represents an updated version of a Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2001, of The Cochrane Library.OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency; outcome of primary interest), headache days, pain intensity and analgesic use.MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials with 2317 participants (median 62, range 10 to 1265) met the inclusion criteria. Two large trials compared acupuncture to treatment of acute headaches or routine care only. Both found statistically significant and clinically relevant short-term (up to 3 months) benefits of acupuncture over control for response, number of headache days and pain intensity. Long-term effects (beyond 3 months) were not investigated. Six trials compared acupuncture with a sham acupuncture intervention, and five of the six provided data for meta-analyses. Small but statistically significant benefits of acupuncture over sham were found for response as well as for several other outcomes. Three of the four trials comparing acupuncture with physiotherapy, massage or relaxation had important methodological or reporting shortcomings. Their findings are difficult to interpret, but collectively suggest slightly better results for some outcomes in the control groups.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for tension-type headache was considered insufficient. Now, with six additional trials, the authors conclude that acupuncture could be a valuable non-pharmacological tool in patients with frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches.","Linde K, Allais G, Brinkhaus B, Manheimer E, Vickers A, White AR",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2009 Jan 21;(1):CD007587. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD007587.,Acupuncture for tension-type headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19160338

Pooled analyses did not show a statistically significant superiority for true acupuncture for any outcome in any of the time windows, but the results of single trials varied considerably. Four trials compared acupuncture to proven prophylactic drug treatment. Overall in these trials acupuncture was associated with slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment. Two small low-quality trials comparing acupuncture with relaxation (alone or in combination with massage) could not be interpreted reliably.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered promising but insufficient. Now, with 12 additional trials, there is consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to treatment of acute migraine attacks only or to routine care. There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions, though this is difficult to interpret, as exact point location could be of limited importance. Available studies suggest that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment, and has fewer adverse effects. Acupuncture should be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment.","Linde K, Allais G, Brinkhaus B, Manheimer E, Vickers A, White AR",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2009 Jan 21;(1):CD001218. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD001218.pub2.,Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19160193
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To observe response characteristics of human brain to acupuncture of corresponding channel point selection and probe into the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture at the points selected along channel.METHODS: Six cases of chronic migraine were treated with acupuncture at Fengchi (GB 20), Waiguan (TE 5), Yang-lingquan (GB 34) on the Shaoyang Channel. Positron emission computerized tomography (PET-CT) was used for scanning and statistic parameter map (SPM 2) software was used to analyze the data and compare with healthy human brain function imaging and investigate the changes of metabolism of glucose in the brain of the patient of migraine before and after acupuncture.RESULTS: After acupuncture, excitation areas of the pain brain regions such as the brain stem, insula, etc. obviously reduced, and the brain function-reducing area turned from the right temporal lobe as main to bilateral temporal lobes with symmetry.CONCLUSION: The pons, insula, anterior frontal gyrus, etc. possibly are the target points of analgesic effect of acupuncture at the Shaoyang Channel on chronic migraine, and the change of metabolism reduction on bilateral temporal lobes induced by acupuncture possibly is one of the mechanisms for acu-puncture at points on the Shaoyang Channel for treatment of migraine.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for treatment of chronic headache.METHODS: We searched the databases of Medline (1966-2007), CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2006), and Scopus for randomized controlled trials investigating the use of acupuncture for chronic headache. Studies were included in which adults with chronic headache, including migraine, tension-type headache or both, were randomized to receive needling acupuncture treatment or control consisting of sham acupuncture, medication therapy, and other nonpharmacological treatments. We extracted the data on headache intensity, headache frequency, and response rate assessed at early and late follow-up periods.RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included in this review. The majority of included trials comparing true acupuncture and sham acupuncture showed a trend in favor of acupuncture. The combined response rate in the acupuncture group was significantly higher compared with sham acupuncture either at the early follow-up period (risk ratio [RR]: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.30) or late follow-up period (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.43). Combined data also showed acupuncture was superior to medication therapy for headache intensity (weighted mean difference: -8.54 mm, 95% CI: -15.52, -1.57), headache frequency (standard mean difference: -0.70, 95% CI: -1.38, -0.02), physical function (weighted mean difference: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.33, 6.98), and response rate (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.17).CONCLUSION: Needling acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture and medication therapy in improving headache intensity, frequency, and response rate.","Sun Y, Gan TJ",Anesth Analg. 2008 Dec;107(6):2038-47. doi: 10.1213/ane.0b013e318187c76a.,Acupuncture for the management of chronic headache: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19020156

"AbstractBACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION: The effectiveness of using acupuncture to treat migraine is rarely and even suspectedly reported in the literature. In this article, we report the design and the protocol of a randomized controlled large-scale trial to treat migraine using acupuncture, aiming at testifying it is effective to use acupuncture to treat migraine. We demonstrate also that the effectiveness of the treatment may vary due to using acupoints of different meridians or different acupoints of one meridian.METHODS AND DESIGN: A multi-center randomized controlled trial is currently undergoing, with three acupoints treatment groups and one non-acupoints control group. The acupuncture treatment consists of 20 sessions per patient with a observation period of 20 weeks. In total, 480 patients with migraine are registered in this study within 8 hospitals in China from March 2008 to June 2009. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four acupoints treatment groups, i.e. 1) specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 2) non-specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 3) acupoints of other meridians (120 patients); or 4) non-acupoints control group (120 patients). The main outcome measurement in this trial is the effect comparison achieved among these four groups in terms of number of days with migraine and intensity of migraine during and after the baseline phase, i.e. the first 4 weeks before randomization and 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomization. The intensity of headache including headache intensity grade (0-3) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score will also be used in this study. In addition, the differences of Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD) before and after randomization are also used as the secondary outcome measurement.DISCUSSION: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2009) will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat migraine, and verify whether the specific effect of acupoints exists and whether this specific effect of acupoints is related to meridian and a collection of meridian Qi.TRIALS REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT00599586.","Li Y, Liang F, Yu S, Liu X, Tang Y, Yang X, Tian X, Yan J, Sun G, Chang X, Zheng H, Zhang H, Ma T",Trials. 2008 Oct 20;9:57. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-9-57.,Randomized controlled trial to treat migraine with acupuncture: design and protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18928574
"AbstractOn November 8-9, 2007, the Society for Acupuncture Research (SAR) hosted an international conference to mark the tenth anniversary of the landmark National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Acupuncture. More than 300 acupuncture researchers, practitioners, students, funding agency personnel, and health policy analysts from 20 countries attended the SAR meeting held at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. This paper summarizes important invited lectures in the area of clinical research. Specifically, included are: a review of the recently conducted German trials and observational studies on low-back pain (LBP), gonarthrosis, migraine, and tension-type headache (the Acupuncture Research Trials and the German Acupuncture Trials, plus observational studies); a systematic review of acupuncture treatment for knee osteoarthritis (OA); and an overview of acupuncture trials in neurologic conditions, LBP, women's health, psychiatric disorders, and functional bowel disorders. A summary of the use of acupuncture in cancer care is also provided. Researchers involved in the German trials concluded that acupuncture is effective for treating chronic pain, but the correct selection of acupuncture points seems to play a limited role; no conclusions could be drawn about the placebo aspect of acupuncture, due to the design of the studies. Overall, when compared to sham, acupuncture did not show a benefit in treating knee OA or LBP, but acupuncture was better than a wait-list control and standard of care, respectively. In women's health, acupuncture has been found to be beneficial for patients with premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, several pregnancy-related conditions, and nausea in females who have cancers. Evidence on moxibustion for breech presentation, induction of labor, and reduction of menopausal symptoms is still inconclusive. In mental health, evidence for acupuncture's efficacy in treating neurologic and functional bowel disorder is still inconclusive. For chronic cancer-related problems such as pain, acupuncture may work well in stand-alone clinics; however, for acute or treatment-related symptoms, integration of acupuncture care into a busy and complex clinical environment is unlikely, unless compelling evidence of a considerable patient benefit can be established.","Park J, Linde K, Manheimer E, Molsberger A, Sherman K, Smith C, Sung J, Vickers A, Schnyer R",J Altern Complement Med. 2008 Sep;14(7):871-81. doi: 10.1089/acm.2008.SAR-4.,The status and future of acupuncture clinical research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18803496
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is associated with chronic widespread pain, mood alteration, and disability. A definitive treatment plan has not been identified. The genesis of FMS is unclear and generally occurs in women.PURPOSE: To determine whether patient-identified most disruptive comorbidity (MDC) secondary to FMS may have mediated recovery for individual patients. This is a probative analysis of data from an effectiveness study published in the March 2006 issue of Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. (2006;12(2):34-41.)METHODS: The American College ofRheumatology (ACR) criteria for FMS was used in participant selection; 21 participants completed the study.RESULTS: The original outcome study indicated significant changes on standardized measures using specific points and numbers of treatment within an 8-week period. The preliminary data on influence ofMDC on improvement were differential related to self-report MDC by patients.CONCLUSIONS: For all MDCs combined, participants experienced significant improvement at 8 weeks of treatment. Participants with irritable bowel syndrome as their MDC generally had a lower percentage of improvement than other MDC cohort groups. This finding has implications for treatment.","Singh BB, Khorsan R, Vinjamury SP",Altern Ther Health Med. 2008 Sep-Oct;14(5):24-5.,Influence of comorbidities on improvement of fibromyalgia symptoms when treated with acupuncture: a short report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18780581

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Migraine is a chronic neurologic disease that can severely affect the patient's quality of life. Although in recent years many randomised studies have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for migraine, it remains a controversial issue. Our aim is to determine whether acupuncture, applied under real conditions of clinical practice in the area of primary healthcare, is more effective than conventional treatment.METHODS/DESIGN: The design consists of a pragmatic multi-centre, three-armed randomised controlled trial, complemented with an economic evaluation of the results achieved, comparing the effectiveness of verum acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and with a control group receiving normal care only. Patients eligible for inclusion will be those presenting in general practice with migraine and for whom their General Practitioner (GP) is considering referral for acupuncture. Sampling will be by consecutive selection, and by randomised allocation to the three branches of the study, in a centralised way following a 1:1:1 distribution (verum acupuncture; sham acupuncture; conventional treatment). Secondly, one patient in three will be randomly selected from each of the acupuncture (verum or sham) groups for a brain perfusion study (by single photon emission tomography). The treatment with verum acupuncture will consist of 8 treatment sessions, once a week, at points selected individually by the acupuncturist. The sham acupuncture group will receive 8 sessions, one per week, with treatment being applied at non-acupuncture points in the dorsal and lumbar regions, using the minimal puncture technique. The control group will be given conventional treatment, as will the other two groups.DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to available evidence on acupuncture for the treatment of migraine. The primary endpoint is the difference in the number of days with migraine among the three groups, between the baseline period (the 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment) and the period from weeks 9 to 12. As a secondary aspect, we shall record the index of laterality and the percentage of change in the mean count per pixel in each region of interest measured by the brain perfusion tomography, performed on a subsample of the patients within the real and sham acupuncture groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN98703707.","Vas J, Rebollo A, Perea-Milla E, Méndez C, Font CR, Gómez-Río M, Martín-Avila M, Carbrera-Iboleón J, Caballero MD, Olmos MA, Aguilar I, Faus V, Martos F",BMC Complement Altern Med. 2008 Apr 14;8:12. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-8-12.,Study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial in general practice investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture against migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18410686
"AbstractPain is a unique personal experience showing variability where gender and sex related effects might contribute. The mechanisms underlying the differences between women and men are currently unknown but are likely to be complex and involving interactions between biological, sociocultural and psychological aspects. In women, painful experimental stimuli are generally reported to produce a greater intensity of pain than in men. Clinical pain is often reported with higher severity and frequency, longer duration, and present in a greater number of body regions in women than in men. Women are also more likely to experience a number of painful conditions such as fibromyalgia, temporomandibular dysfunction, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. With regard to biological factors, quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the endogenous pain inhibitory systems have been implicated, as well as an influence of gonadal hormones. Psychosocial factors like sex role beliefs, pain coping strategies, and pain related expectancies may also contribute to the differences. Being exposed to repeated painful visceral events (eg menses, labour) during life may contribute to an increased sensitivity to, and greater prevalence of, pain among women. When assessing the outcome of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in pain treatment, the factors of gender and sex should be taken into account as the response to an intervention may differ. Preferably, treatment recommendations should be based on studies using both women and men as the norm. Due to variability in results, findings from animal studies and experiments in healthy subjects should be interpreted with care.","Lund I, Lundeberg T",Acupunct Med. 2008 Mar;26(1):33-45.,Is it all about sex?

"AbstractMigraine prophylaxis is a stepwise procedure with lifestyle advice followed by consideration of medications. Patients should be advised to try to maintain a regular lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, exercise, and management of stress, perhaps through relaxation techniques or other ways that are sensible for them. If this regimen does not adequately control their migraines, preventatives are indicated. Patients can choose between evidence-based nutraceuticals such as riboflavin, feverfew, butterbur, or coenzyme Q10, or more traditional pharmacotherapeutics. Medicine choices are somewhat limited by what is available in each country, but from the full range, the medicines of first choice are beta-adrenoceptor blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, and valproic acid. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are particularly useful in patients also suffering from hypertension or tachycardia. Following recent studies, topiramate has become a first choice for episodic as well as chronic migraine. It is the only prophylactic drug that may lead to weight loss, but it is sometimes associated with adverse cognitive effects. Valproic acid and flunarizine also have very good prophylactic properties. However, valproic acid is often associated with adverse effects, and flunarizine is unavailable in many countries, including the United States. If sequential monotherapies are ineffective, combinations of first-line drugs should be tried before advancing to drugs of second choice, which are associated with more adverse effects or have less well-established prophylactic properties. Amitriptyline should be used carefully because of its anticholinergic effects, although it is useful in comorbid tension-type headache, depression, and sleep disorders. Methysergide is very effective, but it has been supplanted or even made unavailable in many countries because of its well-described association with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Pizotifen has a slightly better safety profile but is unavailable in the United States. Aspirin is particularly useful in patients needing platelet inhibitors for other medical conditions, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered. The prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10 are low at best, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options. Magnesium may be particularly useful during pregnancy. Lisinopril and candesartan were shown to be effective in single trials and are preferable in patients with hypertension. Acupuncture may be another alternative; although controlled trials have failed to differentiate its effect from placebo, it is at least innocuous. Botulinum toxin A is not effective in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine.","Schürks M, Diener HC, Goadsby P",Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2008 Jan;10(1):20-9.,Update on the prophylaxis of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18325296
"AbstractThe aim was to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of additional acupuncture treatment in patients with headache compared with patients receiving routine care alone. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted, including patients (> or =18 years old) with primary headache (more than 12 months, at least two headaches/month). Outcome parameters were quality of life (Short Form 36), direct and indirect costs differences during the 3-month study period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of acupuncture treatment. A total of 3182 patients (1613 acupuncture; 1569 controls) with headache were included (77.4% women, mean age and standard deviation 42.6 +/- 12.3; 22.6% men, 47.2 +/- 13.4). Over 3 months costs were higher in the acupuncture group compared with the control [euro857.47; 95% confidence interval 790.86, 924.07, vs. euro527.34 (459.81, 594.88), P < 0.001, mean difference: euro330.12 (235.27, 424.98)]. This cost increase was primarily due to costs of acupuncture [euro365.64 (362.19, 369.10)]. The ICER was euro11 657 per QALY gained. According to international cost-effectiveness threshold values, acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment in patients with primary headache.","Witt CM, Reinhold T, Jena S, Brinkhaus B, Willich SN",Cephalalgia. 2008 Apr;28(4):334-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2982.2007.01504.x.,Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment in patients with headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18315686
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: Qualitative research has an important part to play in investigating how complex interventions are implemented within randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and what impact the RCT context has on participants, their behavior, and their outcomes. We explored these issues within a randomized sham-acupuncture controlled trial of traditional Chinese acupuncture for people with migraine.METHOD: All trial participants who consented to take part in this qualitative study were interviewed twice by a researcher who was blind to all trial data. The acupuncture practitioner was interviewed once. Nineteen (19) semistructured interviews, 30-60 minutes long, were transcribed, coded, and analyzed both across and within cases.RESULTS: The 10 participants, 6 female, age 23-70 years had severe migraine and conventional treatment had been of limited benefit. They were satisfied with the organization of the trial and no acupuncture was perceived as obviously ""sham."" Most participants, and the practitioner, actively ""played their part"" in the trial, taking on research roles that differed from their usual roles of ""patient"" and ""doctor."" The resulting changes to their normal expectations and behavior influenced how the intervention was delivered and experienced. There was a reduction in talking, explanations, and participation, and treatment was focused on the migraine and usually excluded other conditions, even if the participants considered them to be a cause or a trigger of the migraine.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that treatment in the trial differed from that described in studies of ""real life"" traditional acupuncture. These differences affected the needling-the characteristic or specific intervention-as well as contextual factors. This trial design limitation appears to be inevitable when a sham-controlled design is used to research an intervention that is based on a holistic and participative treatment strategy. These findings should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of RCTs of complex interventions such as acupuncture.","Paterson C, Zheng Z, Xue C, Wang Y",J Altern Complement Med. 2008 Mar;14(2):199-208. doi: 10.1089/acm.2007.0682.,"""Playing their parts"": the experiences of participants in a randomized sham-controlled acupuncture trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18315508

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: A dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system is discussed as a pathogenetic factor in migraine. As acupuncture has been shown to exhibit considerable autonomic effects, we tested whether the clinical effects of acupuncture in migraine prophylaxis are mediated by changes of the autonomic regulation.METHODS: We simultaneously monitored changes of heart-rate variability (HRV) as an index of cardiac autonomic control and clinical improvement during an acupuncture treatment in 30 migraineurs. HRV was derived from spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram, which was performed before, during, and after the first and the last session of a series of 12 acupuncture sessions. Migraineurs were randomly allocated to 2 groups receiving either verum acupuncture (VA) or sham acupuncture (SA) treatment.RESULTS: Across the combined VA and SA groups, the clinical responders (with at least 50% reduction of migraine attacks) exhibited a decrease of the low-frequency (LF) power of HRV in the course of the treatment, which was not be observed in patients without clinical benefit. VA compared with SA induced a stronger decrease of high-frequency power. The mode of acupuncture, however, did not have an impact on the LF component of HRV or the clinical outcome.DISCUSSION: The data indicate, that VA and SA acupuncture might have a beneficial influence on the autonomic nervous system in migraineurs with a reduction of the LF power of HRV related to the clinical effect. This might be due to a reduction of sympathetic nerve activity. VA and SA induce different effects on the high-frequency component of HRV, which seem, however, not to be relevant for the clinical outcome in migraine.","Bäcker M, Grossman P, Schneider J, Michalsen A, Knoblauch N, Tan L, Niggemeyer C, Linde K, Melchart D, Dobos GJ",Clin J Pain. 2008 Feb;24(2):106-15. doi: 10.1097/AJP.0b013e318159f95e.,Acupuncture in migraine: investigation of autonomic effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18209515
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of acupuncture in migraine prophylaxis.METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with migraine were enrolled in a randomized control trial at the Headache clinic located in a University Hospital. Real and sham acupuncture groups received 16 acupuncture sessions over 3 months. Treatment was individualized in the real acupuncture group and minimal acupuncture was used in the sham group. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with a >or=50% reduction in their migraine attack frequency in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth (months) compared with the first one (baseline period). Primary and secondary end points were measured comparing headache diaries.RESULTS: Real acupuncture group showed improvement with significant differences compared with the sham acupuncture group in the primary efficacy end point (P=0.021) at the second month of the treatment. Differences also appeared in 2 secondary end points: number of days with migraine per month (P=0.007) in the second month and the percentage of patients with >or=40% reduction in migraine attack frequency in the first (P=0.044) and second months (P=0.004) of the treatment. These differences disappeared in the third (last) month of the treatment as a consequence of the high improvement of the sham acupuncture group. Comparisons within each group showed that several migraine parameters evaluated improved significantly in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individualized treatment based on traditional Chinese medicine plays a role in preventing migraine attacks. Nevertheless, sham acupuncture had similar effects. Major conclusions were limited by the small sample sizes however the observed trends may contribute to design future trials.","Alecrim-Andrade J, Maciel-Júnior JA, Carnè X, Severino Vasconcelos GM, Correa-Filho HR",Clin J Pain. 2008 Feb;24(2):98-105. doi: 10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181590d66.,Acupuncture in migraine prevention: a randomized sham controlled study with 6-months posttreatment follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18209514
"AbstractTo investigate whether laser acupuncture is efficacious in children with headache and if active laser treatment is superior to placebo laser treatment in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low level laser acupuncture in 43 children (mean age (SD) 12.3 (+/-2.6) years) with headache (either migraine (22 patients) or tension type headache (21 patients)). Patients were randomized to receive a course of 4 treatments over 4 weeks with either active or placebo laser. The treatment was highly individualised based on criteria of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The primary outcome measure was a difference in numbers of headache days between baseline and the 4 months after randomization. Secondary outcome measures included a change in headache severity using a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and a change in monthly hours with headache. Measurements were taken during 4 weeks before randomization (baseline), at weeks 1-4, 5-8, 9-12 and 13-16 from baseline. The mean number of headaches per month decreased significantly by 6.4 days in the treated group (p<0.001) and by 1.0 days in the placebo group (p=0.22). Secondary outcome measures headache severity and monthly hours with headache decreased as well significantly at all time points compared to baseline (p<0.001) and were as well significantly lower than those of the placebo group at all time points (p<0.001). We conclude that laser acupuncture can provide a significant benefit for children with headache with active laser treatment being clearly more effective than placebo laser treatment.","Gottschling S, Meyer S, Gribova I, Distler L, Berrang J, Gortner L, Graf N, Shamdeen MG",Pain. 2008 Jul 15;137(2):405-12.

The sources of the referred pain manifested as CH are the disorders of anatomical structures innervated by the first three cervical spinal nerves and/or direct irritation/lesion of these nerves (spinal nerves C1-C3, intervertebral/i.v. joints C0-C3, i.v. disc C2-C3 muscles, ligaments, bony structures, dura mater, vertebral arteries). Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological researches have proven the convergence of nociceptive afferents from the receptive field of the spinal nerves C1-C3, and nociceptive afferents from the receptive field of the trigeminal nerve which occurs in the trigeminocervical nucleus located in the upper segments of the cervical part of the spinal cord. Because of the convergence of the nociceptive afferents in the trigeminocervical nucleus, the pain from the receptive field of the spinal nerves C1-C3 is referred into the receptive field of the trigeminal nerve (head, face), and the pain from the receptive field of the trigeminal nerve is referred into the receptive field of the spinal nerves C1-C3 (cervico-occipital area). Diagnosis of CH can be made on the basis of history, clinical picture, clinical examination and radiological examinations, and confirmed by anesthetic blockade of the affected structure. It is necessary to rule out the other forms of headache in differential diagnosis, first of all migraine and tension headache because of their great similarity with CH. The following is used in the treatment of the CH: medical therapy, acupuncture, neural therapy, local botulinum toxin injection, cervical epidural corticosteroid injection, physical therapy, massage, kinezitherapy, traction and surgical treatment. It seems that the best results are achieved by a combination of manual therapy, physical therapy and kinezitherapy. Although the CH has been included into International headache classification, this hemicranial pain syndrome has still been unknown to a wider circle of medical practicioners. That is why the purpose of this article is to describe etiopathogenesis, characteristics, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy of CH.",Grgić V,Lijec Vjesn. 2007 Jun-Jul;129(6-7):230-6.,"[Cervicogenic headache: etiopathogenesis, characteristics, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18018715
"AbstractAcupuncture treatment is frequently sought for tension-type headache (TTH), but there is conflicting evidence as to its effectiveness. This randomised, controlled, multicentre, patient-and observer-blinded trial was carried out in 122 outpatient practices in Germany on 409 patients with TTH, defined as > or =10 headache days per month of which < or =1 included migraine symptoms. Interventions were verum acupuncture according to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine or sham acupuncture consisting of superficial needling at nonacupuncture points. Acupuncture was administered by physicians with specialist acupuncture training. Ten 30-min sessions were given over a six-week period, with additional sessions available for partial response. Response was defined as >50% reduction in headache days/month at six months and no use of excluded concomitant medication or other therapies. In the intent-to-treat analysis (all 409 patients), 33% of verum patients and 27% of sham controls (p=0.18) were classed as responders. Verum was superior to sham for most secondary endpoints, including headache days (1.8 fewer; 95% CI 0.6, 3.0; p=0.004) and the International Headache Society response criterion (66% vs. 55% response, risk difference 12%, 95% CI: 2%-21%; p=0.024).). The relative risk on the primary and secondary response criterion was very similar ( approximately 0.8); the difference in statistical significance may be due to differences in event rate. TTH improves after acupuncture treatment. However, the degree to which treatment benefits depend on psychological compared to physiological effects and the degree to which any physiological effects depend on needle placement and insertion depth are unclear.","Endres HG, Böwing G, Diener HC, Lange S, Maier C, Molsberger A, Zenz M, Vickers AJ, Tegenthoff M",J Headache Pain. 2007 Oct;8(5):306-14.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To check the effectiveness of a true acupuncture treatment according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in migraine without aura, comparing it to a standard mock acupuncture protocol, an accurate mock acupuncture healing ritual, and untreated controls.BACKGROUND: Migraine prevalence is high and affects a relevant rate of adults in the productive phase of their life. Acupuncture has been increasingly advocated and used in Western countries for migraine treatment, but the evidence of its effectiveness still remains weak. A large variability of treatments is present in published studies and no acupoint selection according to TCM has been investigated so far; therefore, the low level of evidence of acupuncture effectiveness might partly depend on inappropriate treatment.DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled study was performed in 160 patients suffering from migraine without aura, assessed according to the ICD-10 classification. The patients were divided into the following 4 groups: (1) group TA, treated with true acupuncture (according to TCM) plus Rizatriptan; (2) group RMA, treated with ritualized mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (3) group SMA, treated with standard mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (4) group R, without prophylactic treatment with relief therapy only (Rizatriptan). The MIDAS Questionnaire was administered before treatment (T0), at 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) from the beginning of treatment, and the MIDAS Index (MI) was calculated. Rizatriptan intake was also checked in all groups of patients at T0, T1, and T2. Group TA and RMA were evaluated according to TCM as well; then, the former was submitted to true acupuncture and the latter to mock acupuncture treatment resembling the same as TA. The statistical analysis was conducted with factorial ANOVA and multiple tests with a Bonferroni adjustment.RESULTS: A total of 127 patients completed the study (33 dropouts): 32 belonged to group TA, 30 to group RMA, 31 to group SMA, and 34 to group R. Before treatment the MI (T(0)) was moderate to severe with no significant intergroup differences. All groups underwent a decrease of MI at T(1) and T(2), with a significant group difference at both T(1) and T(2) compared to T(0) (P < .0001). Only TA provided a significant improvement at both T(1) and T(2) compared to R (P < .0001). RMA underwent a transient improvement of MI at T(1). The Rizatriptan intake paralleled the MI in all groups.CONCLUSIONS: TA was the only treatment able to provide a steady outcome improvement in comparison to the use of only Rizatriptan, while RMA showed a transient placebo effect at T1.","Facco E, Liguori A, Petti F, Zanette G, Coluzzi F, De Nardin M, Mattia C",Headache. 2008 Mar;48(3):398-407.

"AbstractSince the last Cochrane review of acupuncture and headache in 2001, which found methodological and/or reporting shortcomings in the majority of the studies, several large, randomized trials on the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for headache have been published. Following a brief overview of the pathophysiology of migraine and possible action mechanisms of acupuncture, we look at current studies on acupuncture and migraine and discuss the results. From these results and our own studies on acupuncture and migraine, we conclude that a 6-week course of acupuncture is not inferior to a 6-month prophylactic drug treatment, but that specific Chinese point selection, point stimulation and needling depth are not as important as had been thought. The review suggests that acupuncture should be integrated into existing migraine therapy protocols.","Endres HG, Diener HC, Molsberger A",Expert Rev Neurother. 2007 Sep;7(9):1121-34.,Role of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17868011

"AbstractMigraine headaches are common and among the most disabling nonfatal conditions of humankind. They are frequently misdiagnosed, which may lead to undertreatment. Patients often self-diagnose and self-medicate, resulting in inadequate treatment. Consequently, patients may take additional doses, trying to gain relief with inappropriate medications. Rebound can ensue. With adequate treatment, a patient's condition and quality of life may improve considerably. Patient education is extremely important to help patients identify appropriate self-care measures, such as identification of triggering events and coping with the chronic nature of their condition. This case study presents a patient who began experiencing migraines following a neck injury. His headaches became more frequent, and ergotamine and caffeine (Cafergot) suppositories were prescribed. When he presented, he was experiencing daily headaches and using daily ergotamine and caffeine suppositories. He was using the emergency department (ED) frequently because of severe headaches. Cervical spasm was recognized as his trigger, and the ergotamine and caffeine suppositories were discontinued. After 3 days of severe headaches, his rebound ceased. He reverted back to episodic migraines, which he treated with zolmitriptan (Zomig) nasal spray, which was effective. His cervical spasm was treated with botulinum toxin type A (Botox), with excellent results. He has maintained reasonable headache control for 2 years.",Jung S,J Neurosci Nurs. 2007 Aug;39(4):213-6.,The impact of migraine: a case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17847668

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To compare patient characteristics and outcomes between a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational study (OS) of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Within the framework of a research program for acupuncture for chronic pain, both an RCT and an OS of routine care were performed in patients with migraine. One hundred forty-five patients received acupuncture in the RCT and 732 in the OS. All patients completed a pain questionnaire, including instruments evaluating disability, quality of life, and depression, at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.RESULTS: At baseline, patients participating in the RCT had a significantly longer history of complaints and more headache days but better quality of life and fewer depressive symptoms than patients participating in the OS. In unadjusted analyses, improvements after 6 months were more pronounced in the OS than in the RCT. After adjustment for potential confounders, the differences decreased but were still significant for several outcomes.CONCLUSION: Participants of the RCT were probably not representative of migraine patients undergoing acupuncture treatment in routine care under current regulations in Germany.

"AbstractIn a pooled analysis of four randomized controlled trials of acupuncture in patients with migraine, tension-type headache, chronic low back pain, and osteoarthritis of the knee we investigated the influence of expectations on clinical outcome. The 864 patients included in the analysis received either 12 sessions of acupuncture or minimal (i.e. sham) acupuncture (superficial needling of non-acupuncture points) over an 8 week period. Patients were asked at baseline whether they considered acupuncture to be an effective therapy in general and what they personally expected from the treatment. After three acupuncture sessions patients were asked how confident they were that they would benefit from the treatment strategy they were receiving. Patients were classified as responders if the respective main outcome measure improved by at least fifty percent. Both univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for potential confounders (such as condition, intervention group, age, sex, duration of complaints, etc.) consistently showed a significant influence of attitudes and expectations on outcome. After completion of treatment, the odds ratio for response between patients considering acupuncture an effective or highly effective therapy and patients who were more sceptical was 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.20-2.32). For personal expectations and confidence after the third session, odds ratios were 2.03 (1.26-3.26) and 2.35 (1.68-3.30), respectively. Results from the 6-month follow-up were similar.

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: In a randomized controlled multicenter trial extending over 24 weeks, we investigated whether acupuncture is as effective and safe as metoprolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine under conditions similar to routine care.METHODS: One hundred fourteen migraine patients could be randomized to treatment over 12 weeks either with acupuncture (8 to 15 sessions) or metoprolol (100 to 200 mg daily). Main outcome measure was the difference in the number of migraine days between baseline and the weeks 9 to 12 after randomization (derived from a headache diary).RESULTS: Two of 59 patients randomized to acupuncture withdrew prematurely from the study compared to 18 of 55 randomized to metoprolol. The number of migraine days decreased by 2.5 +/- 2.9 days (baseline 5.8 +/- 2.5 days) in the acupuncture group compared to 2.2 +/- 2.7 days (baseline 5.8 +/- 2.9 days) in the metoprolol group (P= .721). The proportion of responders (reduction of migraine attacks by > or =50%) was 61% for acupuncture and 49% for metoprolol. Both physicians and patients reported fewer adverse effects in the acupuncture group.CONCLUSIONS: Due to missing the recruitment target (480 patients) and the high drop-out in the metoprolol group the results must be interpreted with caution. Still, they suggest that acupuncture might be an effective and safe treatment option for patients unwilling or unable to use drug prophylaxis.","Streng A, Linde K, Hoppe A, Pfaffenrath V, Hammes M, Wagenpfeil S, Weidenhammer W, Melchart D",Headache. 2006 Nov-Dec;46(10):1492-502.,Effectiveness and tolerability of acupuncture compared with metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17115982
"AbstractScalp injection of botulinum toxin type A (BT-A) into the superficial musculature has evoked interest in the management of migraine headache. In clinical trials, prevention of migraine attacks for 3 months or more has been seen in some patients following BT-A scalp injections. In the majority of pain syndromes where BT-A is effective, inhibition of muscle spasms appears to be an important component of its activity. A direct or independent and prolonged analgesic action unrelated to skeletal muscle relaxation is believed to underlie the prophylactic efficacy of BT-A in migraine; peripheral and central modulation of pain impulses by BT-A has also been proposed. A direct peripheral antinociceptive effect was not seen in three controlled studies of BT-A in normal human volunteers. Experimental evidence for BT-A-induced analgesia in rats is suggestive but dose-dependent and lasts only 2 weeks. In migraine patients, a consistent or dose-dependent response to BT-A treatment has not been seen. Peak responses to BT-A in migraine patients are seen at 8-12 weeks, whereas BT-A-affected nerve endings in mice fully recover function between 63 and 91 days; the difference in species limits the interpretation of this dissonance. As BT-A does not normally cross the intact blood-brain barrier, meningeal nociceptors appear unlikely to be influenced by scalp injections of BT-A; the possibility of antidromic transfer of BT-A in the trigeminovascular system should be considered. The extended period for which migraine prophylaxis might be required, the antigenic and headache-provoking potential of BT-A, the inability of BT-A to affect central neuronal processes significantly, including the aura of migraine, the possible placebo effect of needling, and purely subjective outcome measures in headache studies are additional concerns in evaluating this treatment strategy. The clinical utility of BT-A has not been compared against established migraine prophylactic agents. The efficacy of BT-A in preventing migraine headache attacks remains controversial and the underlying scientific rationale is debatable.",Gupta VK,Pain Med. 2006 Sep-Oct;7(5):386-94.,Botulinum toxin--a treatment for migraine?

"AbstractPsychologists and other mental health care professionals are generally trained to incorporate empirical evidence into clinical practice, but few have been taught formal techniques for doing so. Given the rapidity of progress in the clinical sciences, there is a growing need among practitioners to access current, clinically relevant research and have strategies for integrating these research findings into the clinic. In the field of medicine, evidence-based medicine took hold in the early 1990s to provide a framework and skill set for translating research into practice. This method is now widely known as evidence-based practice (EBP) to reflect its applicability to multiple disciplines. In this article, we present a general overview of EBP, illustrate how we used this approach to develop a treatment plan for a patient who had chronic migraine headaches, and discuss some of the opportunities and challenges EBP presents to mental health professionals.","Walker BB, Seay SJ, Solomon AC, Spring B",J Clin Psychol. 2006 Nov;62(11):1367-78.,Treating chronic migraine headaches: an evidence-based practice approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16937349

"AbstractAIM: The aim of this paper is to evaluate previous research studies on acupuncture for migraine with reference to the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture guidelines.BACKGROUND: It is estimated that around 2-15% of the world's population are affected by migraine headaches. Thirteen per cent of adults in the United Kingdom suffer with chronic pain, migraine headaches accounting for 7% of cases. Migraine pain relief is grounded in pharmacology. Acupuncture for migraine has been widely researched. However, inconsistent and low quality results have been produced. Recently, published Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Randomized Trials of Acupuncture guidelines recommend important information that must be included in research in order to be valid and reliable.METHODS: Searches were conducted between September 2003 and May 2004 using the Ovid Medline 1966-2004, British Medical Journal, Blackwell Synergy, Science Direct, The Lancet and Cochrane Library Issue 1 databases. Searches were limited to the previous 20 years and to publications in the English language only.FINDINGS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were critically reviewed for methodological quality, reporting of acupuncture needling details, practitioner background, control interventions and use of a diagnostic criterion. Findings agreed with previous literature reviews that the majority of studies of acupuncture for migraine research are of poor quality, with conflicting results. Few studies met the criteria of the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture recommendations. Overall, the quality of research in this area must be questioned.CONCLUSIONS: In the light of these findings, practitioners may face a dilemma when considering the use of acupuncture for migraine. Therefore, large, high quality randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for migraine are needed. Until better quality research is published, with verification of the benefits of acupuncture for migraine, provision of this alternative therapy should not be expanded or withdrawn.","Griggs C, Jensen J",J Adv Nurs. 2006 May;54(4):491-501.,Effectiveness of acupuncture for migraine: critical literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16671978
"AbstractBACKGROUND: In the nationwide German Acupuncture Trials (GERAC) verum acupuncture, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), was to be tested against sham acupuncture for the entities classified in the West as ""migraine"" (MIG) and ""tension-type headache"" (TTH). However, there were no generally accepted guidelines on how to perform a consistent verum or sham treatment.OBJECTIVE: To design broadly consensual verum and sham acupuncture treatment protocols for MIG and TTH for the GERAC.METHODOLOGY: Extensive literature study and consultation with acupuncture experts. Personal interviews, both free and structured, e-mail discussions, and phone conferences were used.RESULTS: Broadly consensual acupuncture protocols for MIG and TTH for verum and sham acupuncture were developed. They included semi-standardized point combinations with clearly described point selection rules based on TCM acupuncture diagnoses. A procedure was developed to help ensure homogenous treatment quality in a large multicenter trial.CONCLUSIONS: The GERAC study design allowed acupuncture to be tested in a naturalistic environment. The rigorous study design and the large number of physician investigators guaranteed a high external validity for the results. The results will help determine the significance of Chinese acupuncture in the context of Western medicine for the treatment of MIG and TTH.","Molsberger AF, Boewing G, Diener HC, Endres HG, Kraehmer N, Kronfeld K, Zenz M",J Altern Complement Med. 2006 Apr;12(3):237-45.,"Designing an acupuncture study: the nationwide, randomized, controlled, German acupuncture trials on migraine and tension-type headache.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16646722
"AbstractBACKGROUND: This paper aims to describe the characteristics of physicians and interventions of a large, multicenter randomized trial of acupuncture for migraine (ART Migraine) in order to enable acupuncturists to assess the study interventions.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 302 patients suffering from migraine were randomized to 12 sessions of semi-standardized acupuncture (6 predefined basic points, recommendations for optional individual choice of additional points given), standardized minimal acupuncture (superficial needling of at least 5 of 10 predefined, distant non-acupuncture points) or a waiting list. 30 physicians trained and experienced in acupuncture from 18 centers in Germany participated in the trial.RESULTS: The median duration of acupuncture training of trial physicians was 500 h (range 140-1350). Physicians had acupuncture experience for 10 (<1 to 25) years and had treated 200 (60 to >1000) patients with acupuncture in the year preceding trial participation. The 6 basic points were needled in 76-93% of sessions. Compliance with treatment instructions varied considerably among centers in the acupuncture group. In contrast, compliance with the minimal acupuncture protocol was very good. 6 of the 30 physicians stated that they would have treated patients somewhat differently outside the trial, 1 completely differently. The trial found a significant effect of those treated with acupuncture compared to those on the waiting list for treatment, but minimal acupuncture was as effective as acupuncture.CONCLUSIONS: The treatment protocols for acupuncture and minimal acupuncture in ART Migraine appeared an adequate compromise in the specific situation and for the predefined purposes. However, a relevant minority of participating physicians would have treated patients differently outside the trial.","Linde K, Streng A, Hoppe A, Brinkhaus B, Witt CM, Hammes M, Irnich D, Hummelsberger J, Willich SN, Melchart D",Forsch Komplementmed. 2006 Apr;13(2):101-8.

Detailed questionnaires including questions on headache days and instruments measuring disability (Pain Disability Index) and quality of life (SF-36) were completed before treatment, after treatment, and at 6 months after inclusion.RESULTS: A total of 2,022 patients (732 with migraine, 351 with episodic and 440 with chronic TTHs, and 499 with other diagnoses) treated by 1,418 physicians were included in the main analysis. Sociodemographic and baseline characteristics differed considerably in the four diagnostic groups. Statistically highly significant and clinically relevant improvements were seen for all clinical outcome measures in all diagnostic groups. In 52.6% of patients headache frequency decreased by at least 50% compared to baseline. The comparison of headache frequency, pain intensity, and generic outcome measures showed that some of these outcomes correlate only weakly.CONCLUSIONS: In this epidemiological study, headache patients reported clinically relevant improvements after receiving acupuncture. Randomized trials performed in parallel to this study confirm the relevant overall effect, however, the effect may largely be due to potent unspecific needling and placebo effects.","Melchart D, Weidenhammer W, Streng A, Hoppe A, Pfaffenrath V, Linde K",Headache. 2006 Apr;46(4):632-41.,Acupuncture for chronic headaches--an epidemiological study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16643558

"AbstractAlthough migraine is a neurovascular disorder, both scalp tenderness and referred pain have been observed in migraine patients. The present study was carried out to investigate the presence of trigger points eliciting referred pain in 98 migraine patients and in 32 healthy subjects. Trigger points were found in 92 (93.9%) migraineurs and in nine (29%) controls (P < 0.0001). The number of individual migraine trigger points varied from zero to 14 (modal number: 4), and was found to be related to both the frequency of migraine attacks (P < 0.0001), and the duration of the disease (P = 0.017). About 74% of the total detected trigger points were found in temporal and/or suboccipital areas; other locations were mainly found in patients showing more than four trigger points. Trigger point palpation provoked a migraine attack in 30 (30.6%) patients. Pericraneal allodynia was found in 15 (15.3%) patients. These data indicate that nociceptive peripheral sensitization is a usual finding in migraine, and that central sensitization can develop in patients with frequent attacks and long-lasting disease. Trigger points' detection in migraine patients could be useful when applying therapies like acupuncture, needling or botulinum toxin injections directed to reduce peripheral sensitization.","Calandre EP, Hidalgo J, García-Leiva JM, Rico-Villademoros F",Eur J Neurol. 2006 Mar;13(3):244-9.,Trigger point evaluation in migraine patients: an indication of peripheral sensitization linked to migraine predisposition?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16618340
"AbstractMost controlled trials of acupuncture have used minimal, superficial, sham, or 'placebo' acupuncture. It has recently been demonstrated that light touch of the skin stimulates mechanoreceptors coupled to slow conducting unmyelinated (C) afferents resulting in activity in the insular region, but not in the somatosensory cortex. Activity in these C tactile afferents has been suggested to induce a 'limbic touch' response resulting in emotional and hormonal reactions. It is likely that, in many acupuncture studies, control procedures that are meant to be inert are in fact activating these C tactile afferents and consequently result in the alleviation of the affective component of pain. This could explain why control interventions are equally effective as acupuncture in alleviating pain conditions that are predominantly associated with affective components such as migraine or low back pain, but not those with a more pronounced sensory component, such as osteoarthritis of the knee or lateral epicondylalgia.","Lund I, Lundeberg T",Acupunct Med. 2006 Mar;24(1):13-5.,"Are minimal, superficial or sham acupuncture procedures acceptable as inert placebo controls?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16618044

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To study the clinical therapeutic effect of point-through-point acupuncture on migraine and its mechanisms.METHODS: Ninety cases of migraine were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group, 45 cases in each group. The treatment group were treated with point-through-point acupuncture and the control group with normal needling method. Brain blood flow velocity was determined by TCD before and after treatment.RESULTS: The effective rate was 97.8% in the treatment group, which was better than 80.0% in the control group (P < 0.05). And the point-through-point acupuncture could significantly improve the highest mean blood flow velocity of main arteries, with a significant difference between the two groups after treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Point-through-point acupuncture can be used for treatment of migraine, with a high cured rate and obvious therapeutic effect.","Cai YY, Wang S",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu. 2006 Mar;26(3):177-9.,[Therapeutic effect of point-through-point acupuncture on migraine and its effects on brain blood flow velocity].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16570436
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess the efficacy of a part-standardised verum acupuncture procedure, in accordance with the rules of traditional Chinese medicine, compared with that of part-standardised sham acupuncture and standard migraine prophylaxis with beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or antiepileptic drugs in the reduction of migraine days 26 weeks after the start of treatment.METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled, clinical trial, undertaken between April 2002 and July 2005. Patients who had two to six migraine attacks per month were randomly assigned verum acupuncture (n=313), sham acupuncture (n=339), or standard therapy (n=308). Patients received ten sessions of acupuncture treatment in 6 weeks or continuous prophylaxis with drugs. Primary outcome was the difference in migraine days between 4 weeks before randomisation and weeks 23-26 after randomisation. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN52683557.FINDINGS: Of 1295 patients screened, 960 were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Immediately after randomisation, 125 patients (106 from the standard group) withdrew their consent to study participation. 794 patients were analysed in the intention-to-treat popoulation and 443 in the per-protocol population. The primary outcome showed a mean reduction of 2 .3 days (95% CI 1.9-2.7) in the verum acupuncture group, 1.5 days (1.1-2.0) in the sham acupuncture group, and 2.1 days (1.5-2.7) in the standard therapy group. These differences were statistically significant compared with baseline (p<0.0001), but not across the treatment groups (p=0.09). The proportion of responders, defined as patients with a reduction of migraine days by at least 50%, 26 weeks after randomisation, was 47% in the verum group, 39% in the sham acupuncture group, and 40% in the standard group (p=0.133).INTERPRETATION: Treatment outcomes for migraine do not differ between patients treated with sham acupuncture, verum acupuncture, or standard therapy.","Diener HC, Kronfeld K, Boewing G, Lungenhausen M, Maier C, Molsberger A, Tegenthoff M, Trampisch HJ, Zenz M, Meinert R, GERAC Migraine Study Group",Lancet Neurol. 2006 Apr;5(4):310-6.,Efficacy of acupuncture for the prophylaxis of migraine: a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545747

"AbstractOn the current discussion about efficacy and ""point-specificity"" of the needle therapy To improve the evidence base for acupuncture in pain treatment the German health insurance initiated the so called ""Acupuncture randomised trials (ART)"" and ""German Acupuncture Trials"" (GERAC) with a sample size of 300 (ART) and 1000 (GERAC) patients, providing a new dimension in acupuncture research. These studies have yielded data, which indicate that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of migraine, tension type headache, osteoarthritis of the knee and chronic low back pain. For the two latter indications acupuncture showed an even higher therapeutic response rate than conventional standard treatment. In migraine acupuncture showed an effect comparable to pharmacological treatment. The studies moreover indicate that the relevance of point-specific effects may have been overestimated concerning some indications. This article discusses the results of ART and GERAC, based on differentiating the mechanisms of action in acupuncture therapy. It is shown that the current data neither support the postulate of a ""no-matter-where acupuncture"" nor the irrefutability of the theorems of Chinese Medicine. Future studies will have to determine more precisely the mechanism by which the therapeutic effect of acupuncture is mediated. Furthermore, it will be necessary to find out more clearly in what diseases the location of needling represents the crucial part of the treatment and in what diseases rather different factors, like the intensity of stimulation or the doctor-patient interaction, are more relevant for the therapeutic effect. Research into acupuncture is still at the beginning. For this reason it should be avoided to draw premature and untenable conclusions from the current data.","Bäcker M, Tao I, Dobos GJ",Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2006 Mar 10;131(10):506-11.,[Acupuncture: quo vadis?].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511742
"AbstractThis study presents the result of the studies explaining the effects of acupuncture on various systems and symptoms. It has been determined that endomorphin-1, beta endorphin, encephalin, and serotonin levels increase in plasma and brain tissue through acupuncture application. It has been observed that the increases of endomorphin-1, beta endorphin, encephalin, serotonin, and dopamine cause analgesia, sedation, and recovery in motor functions. They also have immunomodulator effects on the immune system and lipolithic effects on metabolism. Because of these effects, acupuncture is used in the treatment of pain syndrome illnesses such as migraine, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and trigeminal neuralgia; of gastrointestinal disorders such as disturbance at gastrointestinal motility and gastritis; of psychological illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and panic attack; and in rehabilitation from hemiplegia and obesity.","Cabýoglu MT, Ergene N, Tan U",Int J Neurosci. 2006 Feb;116(2):115-25.,The mechanism of acupuncture and clinical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16393878

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: Conflicting or ambivalent findings on the effectiveness of body acupuncture in pain treatment are often attributed to flaws in study methodology. The paper describes the methodology used for the German Acupuncture Trials (gerac), which demonstrates that it is possible to design acupuncture studies in accordance with the standards of good clinical practice.METHOD: Approximately 1000 chronic pain sufferers per indication (migraine, tension-type headache, low back pain (cLBP), or gonarthrosis) are randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups (verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or established conservative therapy). Patients are blind to the type of acupuncture. All patients receive ten sessions of treatment (two per week) with an option of adding five more treatments in cases of slight but insufficient improvement (number of headache days or von Korff pain score). Participating physicians are in private practice, representing a variety of specialties. All have completed at least a 140-hour training course in acupuncture. Mandatory and optional verum and sham points are predefined. The point selection is individualized according to the criteria of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Primary outcome measures are number of headache days per month, von Korff Graded Chronic Pain Scale or Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire (cLBP), or WOMAC scores (gonarthrosis). Data are assessed by trained telephone interviewers not involved in treatment and blind to types of acupuncture.PRESENT STATUS: Over 500 participating physicians in ten urban areas of Germany. Patient recruitment for cLBP and gonarthrosis was completed in November 2003 and March 2004 respectively. Recruitment for chronic headaches will be completed in autumn 2004.CONCLUSIONS: The gerac trials prove that it is possible to design and carry out acupuncture studies in accordance to stringent standards of methodology and clinical practice. The results will form a basis for the assessment of acupuncture effectiveness in Germany and abroad.","Endres HG, Zenz M, Schaub C, Molsberger A, Haake M, Streitberger K, Skipka G, Maier C, Leitungsgremium der gerac-Studien","Schmerz. 2005 Jun;19(3):201-4, 206, 208-10 passim.",[German Acupuncture Trials (gerac) address problems of methodology associated with acupuncture studies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15959826
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Primary headache disorders, especially migraine, are commonly accompanied by neck pain or other symptoms. Because of this, physical therapy (PT) and other physical treatments are often prescribed. This review updates and synthesizes published clinical trial evidence, systematic reviews, and case series regarding the efficacy of selected physical modalities in the treatment of primary headache disorders.METHODS: The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE), The Cochrane Library, and other sources of information were searched through June 2004 to identify clinical studies, systematic reviews, case series, or other information published in English that assessed the treatment of headache or migraine with chiropractic, osteopathic, PT, or massage interventions.RESULTS: PT is more effective than massage therapy or acupuncture for the treatment of TTH and appears to be most beneficial for patients with a high frequency of headache episodes. PT is most effective for the treatment of migraine when combined with other treatments such as thermal biofeedback, relaxation training, and exercise. Chiropractic manipulation demonstrated a trend toward benefit in the treatment of TTH, but evidence is weak. Chiropractic manipulation is probably more effective in the treatment of tension-type headache (TTH) than it is in the treatment of migraine. Evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy of these treatments in reducing headache frequency, intensity, duration, and disability in many commonly encountered clinical situations. Many of the published case series and controlled studies are of low quality.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Further studies of improved quality are necessary to more firmly establish the place of physical modalities in the treatment of primary headache disorders. With the exception of high velocity chiropractic manipulation of the neck, the treatments are unlikely to be physically dangerous, although the financial costs and lost treatment opportunity by prescribing potentially ineffective treatment may not be insignificant. In the absence of clear evidence regarding their role in treatment, physicians and patients are advised to make cautious and individualized judgments about the utility of physical treatments for headache management; in most cases, the use of these modalities should complement rather than supplant better-validated forms of therapy.",Biondi DM,Headache. 2005 Jun;45(6):738-46.,Physical treatments for headache: a structured review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15953306
"AbstractPrimary headache disorders are often accompanied by neck pain or other symptoms referable to neck muscles. Therefore, physical therapy and other physical treatments are commonly prescribed for headache management. A medical literature review was completed in order to gather information regarding the efficacy of selected physical modalities in the treatment of primary and cervicogenic headache disorders. After analyzing the collected data, expert opinions were developed regarding the utility and efficacy of selected physical modalities in the management of primary and cervicogenic headaches. Based on this review, the following four expert opinions are presented: physical therapy is more effective than massage therapy or acupuncture for the treatment of tension-type headache and appears to be most beneficial for patients with a high frequency of headache attacks. Physical therapy is most effective for the treatment of migraine when combined with other treatments such as thermal biofeedback, relaxation training and exercise. Chiropractic manipulation demonstrated a trend towards benefit in the treatment of tension-type headache, but evidence is weak. Chiropractic manipulation is probably more effective in the treatment of tension-type headache than it is in the treatment of migraine. In general, strong evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy of these treatments in reducing headache frequency, intensity, duration and disability in many commonly encountered clinical situations. Many of the published case series and controlled studies are of low quality. Physical treatments are unlikely to pose a significant risk, with the exception of high velocity chiropractic manipulation of the neck. Consideration must be given to financial costs and lost treatment opportunity by prescribing potentially ineffective treatment. In the absence of clear evidence regarding their role in treatment, physicians and patients are advised to make cautious and individualized judgments about the utility of physical treatments for headache management. In most cases, the use of physical modalities should complement rather than replace better validated forms of therapy. The evidence base to determine the safety and efficacy of physical treatments in the management of headache disorders would be substantially improved by using standard scientific rigor in the development and conduct of future clinical studies.",Biondi DM,Expert Rev Neurother. 2005 May;5(3):355-62.,Noninvasive treatments for headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15938668
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditures of over 34 billion dollars per year in the US are an apparent testament to a widely held belief that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have benefits that outweigh their costs. However, regardless of public opinion, there is often little more than anecdotal evidence on the health and economic implications of CAM therapies. The objectives of this study are to present an overview of economic evaluation and to expand upon a previous review to examine the current scope and quality of CAM economic evaluations.METHODS: The data sources used were Medline, AMED, Alt-HealthWatch, and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Citation Index; January 1999 to October 2004. Papers that reported original data on specific CAM therapies from any form of standard economic analysis were included. Full economic evaluations were subjected to two types of quality review. The first was a 35-item checklist for reporting quality, and the second was a set of four criteria for study quality (randomization, prospective collection of economic data, comparison to usual care, and no blinding).RESULTS: A total of 56 economic evaluations (39 full evaluations) of CAM were found covering a range of therapies applied to a variety of conditions. The reporting quality of the full evaluations was poor for certain items, but was comparable to the quality found by systematic reviews of economic evaluations in conventional medicine. Regarding study quality, 14 (36%) studies were found to meet all four criteria. These exemplary studies indicate CAM therapies that may be considered cost-effective compared to usual care for various conditions: acupuncture for migraine, manual therapy for neck pain, spa therapy for Parkinson's, self-administered stress management for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pre- and post-operative oral nutritional supplementation for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery, biofeedback for patients with ""functional"" disorders (eg, irritable bowel syndrome), and guided imagery, relaxation therapy, and potassium-rich diet for cardiac patients.CONCLUSION: Whereas the number and quality of economic evaluations of CAM have increased in recent years and more CAM therapies have been shown to be of good value, the majority of CAM therapies still remain to be evaluated.","Herman PM, Craig BM, Caspi O",BMC Complement Altern Med. 2005 Jun 2;5:11.,Is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) cost-effective?

"AbstractThere is increasing evidence that somatic acupuncture can be helpful in migraine treatment, but substantial data on ear acupuncture (EAP) are still lacking. EAP can be useful both in the diagnosis and in the treatment of many medical conditions. As regards the control of migrainous pain, we present a case report in which a procedure called the ""needle-contact test"" is described in detail. During a migraine attack, the patient undergoes an accurate search for tender points of the outer ear by means of a specific pressure algometer. Once the most sensitive point has been identified, an acupuncture needle is placed in contact with it for about 10 s, without skin penetration. The expected effect is a quick and evident reduction of acute pain. If no appreciable variation in pain intensity occurs within the following 60 s, a second or third attempt is made on other previously identified tender points, until the point at which the patient notices a clear remission of pain is found. In this positive case, the same testing needle can be immediately used for therapy, completely penetrating the skin, and then extracted after about 30 min. Alternatively, a temporary needle can be implanted and left in situ for a variable period of time (1-15 days). This innovative technique allows the identification, with maximum accuracy, of the most effective ear acupoints on migraine pain during acute attacks.","Romoli M, Allais G, Airola G, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2005 May;26 Suppl 2:s158-61.,"Ear acupuncture in the control of migraine pain: selecting the right acupoints by the ""needle-contact test"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15926019
"AbstractNonpharmacologic treatment of migraine is often used by patients and can provide interesting options for physicians. Knowledge about the evidence and its absence is important. Avoidance of trigger factors can help, if individualized. Behavioral approaches, such as relaxation techniques, biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, require far more specialist time or technical devices, but are supported by some evidence, which is mostly old. The same is true for hypnosis. A new approach in migraine prevention is aerobic exercise, which is associated with positive side effects. Whether it will take a strong role, similar to the treatment of depression, remains to be seen. There is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of spinal manipulation. Hyperbaric oxygen may be an effective, but rarely practical prophylactic measure. The evidence pertaining to the efficacy of acupuncture is controversial because of methodologic difficulties, but an ongoing large German study may provide valuable evidence in the near future. Nutritional supplements acting on mitochondrial metabolism, such as magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10, were shown to be effective in small, randomized, controlled trials. More studies on the different therapeutic interventions are needed, using modern diagnostic standards and state-of-the-art trial methodology.","Sándor PS, Afra J",Curr Pain Headache Rep. 2005 Jun;9(3):202-5.,Nonpharmacologic treatment of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15907259

"AbstractCONTEXT: Acupuncture is widely used to prevent migraine attacks, but the available evidence of its benefit is scarce.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture and with no acupuncture in patients with migraine.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Three-group, randomized, controlled trial (April 2002-January 2003) involving 302 patients (88% women), mean (SD) age of 43 (11) years, with migraine headaches, based on International Headache Society criteria. Patients were treated at 18 outpatient centers in Germany.INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or waiting list control. Acupuncture and sham acupuncture were administered by specialized physicians and consisted of 12 sessions per patient over 8 weeks. Patients completed headache diaries from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after randomization and from week 21 to 24 after randomization.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in headache days of moderate or severe intensity between the 4 weeks before and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization.RESULTS: Between baseline and weeks 9 to 12, the mean (SD) number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity decreased by 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.2 (2.5) days in the acupuncture group compared with a decrease to 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.0 (2.4) days in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.8 (2.0) days from a baseline if 5.4 (3.0) days in the waiting list group. No difference was detected between the acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups (0.0 days, 95% confidence interval, -0.7 to 0.7 days; P = .96) while there was a difference between the acupuncture group compared with the waiting list group (1.4 days; 95% confidence interval; 0.8-2.1 days; P<.001). The proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50%) was 51% in the acupuncture group, 53% in the sham acupuncture group, and 15% in the waiting list group.CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing migraine headaches although both interventions were more effective than a waiting list control.","Linde K, Streng A, Jürgens S, Hoppe A, Brinkhaus B, Witt C, Wagenpfeil S, Pfaffenrath V, Hammes MG, Weidenhammer W, Willich SN, Melchart D",JAMA. 2005 May 4;293(17):2118-25.,Acupuncture for patients with migraine: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15870415

"AbstractA small number of fully trained Chinese doctors practise Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in western cities. Use of these services by British citizens is extremely limited, mostly due to lack of any knowledge on the effectiveness of acupuncture or exposure to complementary medicine in this country. Common situations where British patients seek the help of TCM are when medical therapy has failed; in relapsing chronic diseases like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis; and in pain management (mostly headache, migraine and back pain). Patients often appreciate that only limited interventions are available for treatment of these conditions in western medicine. At least one in 10 UK specialist physicians are actively involved in complementary and alternative medicine treatments.(1) A large number of westerners offer acupuncture therapy but lack basic medical training. It is likely that people are reluctant to use these services largely because of hygiene and safety reasons. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the serious side effects reported are five times more frequent when treatments are provided by non-medically trained therapists compared with professionally registered health care providers.(2).","Rosted P, Warnakulasuriya S",Br Dent J. 2005 Feb 12;198(3):139-43.,A survey on the uses of acupuncture by a group of UK dentists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15706375
"AbstractThe objectives were to introduce a new method for controlled trials of acupuncture in the field of headache research and to examine the role of needling per se. Women with menstrually related migraine were randomized to three months of treatment with verum or placebo needles. Three standard size casts were moulded to secure the placebo needles in the head. No significant differences were found between the verum group (n=15) and the placebo group (n=13) during treatment or follow up three and six months later, either in the attack frequency or in the number of days per month with migraine, headache intensity or drug-use. The casts held the needles exactly in place despite movements of the head, and are validated as practical, hygienic and extremely durable. This method is satisfactory for controlled studies of acupuncture in headache. It is possible that the positive results in earlier clinical trials on acupuncture in migraine are attributable to other mechanisms than needling of subcutaneous tissue.","Linde M, Fjell A, Carlsson J, Dahlöf C",Cephalalgia. 2005 Jan;25(1):41-7.,Role of the needling per se in acupuncture as prophylaxis for menstrually related migraine: a randomized placebo-controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606569
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a clinical treatment program with traditional Chinese medicine for migraine and tension-type headache.METHODS: Ninety-one patients with migraine, episodic or chronic tension-type headache according to the criteria of the International Headache Society were randomised into an experimental or a waiting list control group. Patients in the experimental group were treated 4 weeks in a hospital for traditional Chinese medicine after a baseline period of one month. Patients in the waiting list group continued their previous headache treatment. Main outcome measure was the difference in the number of days with headache of at least moderate intensity during baseline (month 1) and month 7.RESULTS: The difference in the number of days with headache of at least moderate intensity was 5.6 (S.D., 6.1) days in the experimental group and 1.2 (S.D., 4.5) days in the waiting list group (P <0.001). A reduction of more than 50% in headache days was observed in 52% of the patients in the experimental group and 16% in the waiting list group. Patients with migraine and a combination of migraine and episodic tension-type headaches improved more than patients with other headaches.CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that treatment in the hospital for traditional Chinese medicine in Kotzting is associated with lasting improvements in the majority of patients.","Melchart D, Hager S, Hager U, Liao J, Weidenhammer W, Linde K",Complement Ther Med. 2004 Jun-Sep;12(2-3):71-8.,"Treatment of patients with chronic headaches in a hospital for traditional Chinese medicine in Germany.

"AbstractBesides pharmacological treatments for migraine, alternative non-pharmacological treatment strategies might be effective. In 2001, a Cochrane review concluded that acupuncture might be effective in migraine. The authors of a recent large trial also claimed that acupuncture might reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. However, this study failed to provide a clear answer due to serious methodological short-comings, for example with respect to randomisation and the clinical relevance of the main findings. In another recent, large, randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of acupuncture was not significantly different from that of the sham procedure. In conclusion, acupuncture is probably not effective in the prevention of migraine.","Schoonman GG, Wiendels NJ, Ferrari MD",Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2004 Oct 30;148(44):2165-6.,[Still no proof of the efficacy of acupuncture in the prevention of migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15559408
"AbstractThe treatment of migraine takes into consideration the intensity of the headache and the accompanying symptoms. The goal is to reduce the headache intensity, to relieve nausea and vomiting and to restore the ability to function in the daily routine. For drug treatment, there are now highly effective serotonin agonists available in addition to the older ergotamine preparations. A problem with all migraine analgesics is that in long lasting migraine attacks, the headache can recur as the pharmacological effect of the medication wears off. Through nonmedicinal and medicinal prophylactic measures, the frequency and intensity of the migraine attacks can be reduced. Keeping a headache diary for documentation is essential.","Diener HC, Gendolla A","MMW Fortschr Med. 2004 Sep 2;146(35-36):41, 43-5.",[Treatment and prophylaxis of an acute migraine attack].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15540539
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of a policy of using acupuncture, compared with a policy of avoiding acupuncture, on headache in primary care patients with chronic headache disorders. The effects of acupuncture on medication use, quality of life, resource use and days off sick in this population and the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture were also examined.DESIGN: Randomised, controlled trial.SETTING: General practices in England and Wales.PARTICIPANTS: The study included 401 patients with chronic headache disorder, predominantly migraine.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over 3 months or to a control intervention offering usual care.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included headache score; assessment of Short Form 36 (SF-36) health status and use of medication at baseline, 3 months and 12 months; assessment of use of resources every 3 months; and assessment of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.RESULTS: Headache score at 12 months, the primary end-point, was lower in the acupuncture group than in controls. The adjusted difference between means was 4.6. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis incorporating imputation for missing data. Patients in the acupuncture group experienced the equivalent of 22 fewer days of headache per year. SF-36 data favoured acupuncture, although differences reached significance only for physical role functioning, energy and change in health. Compared with controls, patients randomised to acupuncture used 15% less medication, made 25% fewer visits to GPs and took 15% fewer days off sick. Total costs during the 1-year period of the study were on average higher for the acupuncture group than for controls because of the acupuncture practitioners' costs. The mean health gain from acupuncture during the year of the trial was 0.021 QALYs, leading to a base-case estimate of GBP9180 per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis. Cost per QALY dropped substantially when the analysis incorporated likely QALY differences for the years after the trial.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that acupuncture leads to persisting, clinically relevant benefits for primary care patients with chronic headache, particularly migraine. It is relatively cost-effective compared with a number of other interventions provided by the NHS. Further studies could examine the duration of acupuncture effects beyond 1 year and the relative benefit to patients with migraine with compared to tension-type headache. Trials are also warranted examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with headache receiving more aggressive pharmacological management.","Vickers AJ, Rees RW, Zollman CE, McCarney R, Smith CM, Ellis N, Fisher P, Van Haselen R, Wonderling D, Grieve R","Health Technol Assess. 2004 Nov;8(48):iii, 1-35.",Acupuncture of chronic headache disorders in primary care: randomised controlled trial and economic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15527670

"AbstractOVERVIEW AND METHODS: This paper discusses those medical conditions in which clinical trials of acupuncture have been conducted, and where meta-analyses or systematic reviews have been published. It focuses on the general conclusions of these reviews by further examining official reviews conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada each of which examined available systematic reviews. While all reviews agree that the methodological rigor of acupuncture clinical trials has generally been poor and that higher quality clinical trials are necessary, this has not completely hampered the interpretation of the results of these clinical trials. In some conditions the evidence of efficacy has clearly reached a sufficient critical mass from enough well-designed studies to draw clear conclusions; for the rest, the evidence is difficult to clearly interpret. This paper also examines conclusions from the same international reviews on the safety and adverse effects of acupuncture. Here, conclusions are more easily drawn and there is good agreement about the safety of acupuncture.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: General international agreement has emerged that acupuncture appears to be effective for postoperative dental pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. For migraine, low-back pain, and temporomandibular disorders the results are considered positive by some and difficult to interpret by others. For a number of conditions such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis of the knee, and tennis elbow the evidence is considered promising, but more and better quality research is needed. For conditions such as chronic pain, neck pain, asthma, and drug addiction the evidence is considered inconclusive and difficult to interpret. For smoking cessation, tinnitus, and weight loss the evidence is usually regarded as negative. Reviews have concluded that while not free from serious adverse events, they are rare and that acupuncture is a relatively safe procedure.Copyright Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Birch S, Hesselink JK, Jonkman FA, Hekker TA, Bos A",J Altern Complement Med. 2004 Jun;10(3):468-80.,Clinical research on acupuncture.

"AbstractMigraine is a typical ""women's disease"": the fluctuations of sex hormones, in particular estrogens, during woman's reproductive life show a direct and major influence on migraine course. Even if during pregnancy a high percentage of migraineurs report an improvement of symptomatology, it is still controversial how to manage migraine crises occurring during pregnancy, considering that almost all drugs are partially or totally contraindicated during gestation. The most important drugs employed in acute attack management (triptans, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, antiemetics, ergot derivatives and combination products) are reviewed and the indications and contraindications of their use during the 3 trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation, taking into consideration the indications of the Food and Drug Administration and of the American Academy of Pediatrics, are analysed. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the 2 most important non pharmacological therapies used for migraine prophylaxis, biofeedback and acupuncture, are discussed. For this latter therapy, the personal preliminary positive experience using a predetermined formula of acupoints for the combined treatment of migraine and hyperemesis gravidarum is reported.","Allais G, Bosio A, Mana O, Airola G, Ciochetto D, Terzi MG, De Lorenzo C, Quirico PE, Benedetto C",Minerva Med. 2003 Aug;94(4 Suppl 1):27-38.,[Migraine during pregnancy and lactation: treatment of the acute attack and non-pharmacological prophylactic strategies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15108609
"AbstractThe frequency of use of traditional Chinese drugs was investigated in relation to Western and Chinese diagnostic classifications in a hospital for traditional Chinese medicine in Germany. All 1597 in-patients treated in the hospital between February 1992 and August 1993 entered a prospective observational study. About two thirds of the patients suffered from chronic pain syndromes, the most frequent single diagnosis being migraine (n=244). All patients were treated with at least one of four Chinese therapies (traditional Chinese drugs, acupuncture, Tuina-massage, Qi-gong). 95.1% of all patients received traditional Chinese drug treatment, prescribed in complex prescriptions including 3 to 12 single drugs from a total of 305. Drug patterns prescribed to patients with the same Western diagnosis tended to be similar, but could differ strongly for single drugs in subgroups with distinct Chinese diagnoses. Studies evaluating traditional Chinese treatment strategies in patients classified according to Western nosology should take into account possible diagnostic differences according to Chinese nosology. The development of a reliable coding system for Chinese diagnostic classifications is a precondition for further cross-cultural studies.","Melchart D, Linde K, Weidenhammer W, Hager S, Liao J, Bauer R, Wagner H",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 1999 Mar;8(2):115-20.,Use of traditional drugs in a hospital of Chinese medicine in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073936

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of repetitive somatosensory stimulation (acupuncture) on cerebrovascular response in migraineurs by functional transcranial Doppler.METHODS: Changes of cerebral blood flow velocity in the right posterior and left middle cerebral arteries were measured by functional transcranial Doppler during visual stimulation (flickering light over 57 seconds) in 10 migraineurs before and after 10 acupuncture sessions. The same stimulation paradigm was performed in 10 control subjects. Cerebral blood flow velocity data were analyzed with a previously validated technique based on automated stimulus-related averaging. To evaluate the clinical effect of the treatment, a headache diary monitored the frequency and intensity of the migraine attacks. A positive treatment effect was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in the attack frequency or the mean headache intensity (or both).RESULTS: Before treatment, migraineurs showed overshooting cerebral blood flow velocity changes at the beginning and at the end of the stimulation and a delayed decline to baseline compared with control subjects. After treatment, this response pattern was significantly diminished (P</=.05) in those who benefited from treatment (n = 6). Those who did not benefit from treatment (n = 4) showed a significantly (P</=.05) more marked alteration of the cerebral blood flow velocity pattern.CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that repetitive somatosensory stimulation (acupuncture) might positively influence the abnormal cerebrovascular response in migraineurs. In a subgroup of migraineurs, however, the dysfunction of the cerebrovascular system might deteriorate under the treatment.","Bäcker M, Hammes M, Sander D, Funke D, Deppe M, Tölle TR, Dobos GJ",Headache. 2004 Jan;44(1):95-101.,Changes of cerebrovascular response to visual stimulation in migraineurs after repetitive sessions of somatosensory stimulation (acupuncture): a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14979891

"AbstractWe conducted a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN96537534) to assess the effects of acupuncture on migraine and chronic tension headache. Patients (n=401) completed a diary of headache severity four times a day for 4 weeks at baseline, immediately following a 3-month treatment period and 1 year after randomization. During the trial, it appeared that dropout might be higher than expected. We therefore obtained a rapid global assessment of headache from participants to aid imputation of missing data. Patients were contacted by telephone and asked to rate current and baseline headache on a 0-10 scale. Use of global assessment reduced the number of patients from whom we obtained no follow-up headache data from 69 (17%) to 24 (6%). Analysis of patients who provided both a diary and a global assessment demonstrated excellent properties of global assessment, with very similar results to the full diary. We therefore used the global assessment to help impute missing 1-year diary scores. Rapid global assessment can be easily implemented in any trial and aids imputation of missing data, though it should not be used instead of more intensive methods of assessment. Further research might usefully examine the value of global assessment for imputation of missing data in a variety of different settings.","Vickers AJ, McCarney R",Control Clin Trials. 2003 Dec;24(6):731-5.,Use of a single global assessment to reduce missing data in a clinical trial with follow-up at one year.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662279
"AbstractTo determine efficacy of acupuncture (AC) in combined treatment of chronic daily headache (CDHA), 90 patients with this disorder were studied, using clinico-neurologic tests. Severity of patient's state was evaluated with Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, including scoring of disease severity, global evaluation of the post treatment state dynamics and the index of therapeutic efficacy. Headache intensity was assessed with VAS. A state of functional activity of nociceptive and antinociceptive systems was studied, using nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR). For treatment, the patients were randomly divided into two clinically matched groups: group 1 received combined drug therapy, group 2--combined drug therapy and additional acupuncture course. The results revealed high efficacy of AC combined with drug therapy for CDHA treatment. Most efficient was use of AC in patients with significantly reduced activity of antinociceptive systems and presence of drug abuse allowing to reduce analgetics withdrawal time. Besides, more pronounced clinical effect of AC was obtained in patients with transformed migraine.","Naprienko MV, Oknin VIu, Kremenchugskaia MR, Filatova EG",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 2003;103(10):40-4.,[Use of acupuncture in the therapy of chronic daily headache].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628586

"AbstractBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We report the design and essentials of the protocols of two Acupuncture Randomized Trials (ART) investigating whether acupuncture is more efficacious than no treatment and minimal acupuncture in the interval treatment of migraine and tension-type headache.DESIGN: Randomized controlled multicenter trials with three treatment arms and a total observation period of 28 weeks.SETTING: 30 practitioners and outpatient units in Germany specialized in acupuncture treatment.PATIENTS: Per study 300 patients with migraine and episodic or chronic tension-type headache, respectively (diagnosis according to the criteria of the International Headache Society).INTERVENTIONS: Patients are randomly assigned to receive either (1) semi-standardized acupuncture (150 patients), (2) standardized minimal acupuncture (75 patients), or (3) no interval treatment for 12 weeks followed by semi-standardized acupuncture (75 patients, waiting list control). Acupuncture treatment consists of 12 sessions per patient over a period of 8 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Main outcome measure in the migraine trial is the difference between the number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity during the 4 weeks before randomization and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization. In the study on tension-type headache the main outcome measure is similar to that described above, but for the number of headache days regardless of intensity.OUTLOOK: The results of these two studies (available in 2004) will provide health care providers and policy makers with the information needed to make scientifically sound assessments of acupuncture therapy.Copyright 2003 S.

We have applied this drug to treat hyperhidrosis and wrinkles in dermatology; it offers also a secondary benefit: relief for headaches.OBJECTIVE: : We have performed studies based on acupuncture principles in order to develop new botulinum toxin application sites for the treatment of migraine. These additional sites are helpful when patients expect results for both their illness and their wrinkles; whereas some patients will show improvement with the classic treatment for wrinkles, additional sites may be required.METHODS: : Ten patients suffering from migraine, as diagnosed through the criteria proposed by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, were selected. We used easily recognizable acupuncture sites for the injection of botulinum toxin.RESULTS: : There was significant improvement in patients with acupuncture site-guided botulinum toxin injection. It showed to be a safe and effective therapy for migraine.CONCLUSION: : There are alternative sites besides those used for the treatment of expression lines, which bring forth an improvement of migraine.","Tamura BM, Chang B",Dermatol Surg. 2003 Jul;29(7):749-54.,Botulinum toxin: application into acupuncture points for migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12828700
"AbstractIn an open, randomized trial, we evaluated transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), infrared lasertherapy and acupuncture in the treatment of transformed migraine, over a 4-month period free of prophylactic drugs. Sixty women suffering from transformed migraine were assigned, after a one month run-in period, to three different treatments: TENS (Group T; n=20), infrared lasertherapy (Group L; n=20) or acupuncture (Group A; n=20). In each group the patients underwent ten sessions of treatment and monthly control visits. In Group T patients were treated for two weeks (5 days/week) simultaneously with three TENS units with different stimulation parameters (I: pulse rate = 80 Hz, pulse width = 120 micros; II: 120 Hz, 90 micros; III: 4 Hz, 200 micros). In Group L an infrared diode laser (27 mW, 904 nm) was applied every other day on tender scalp spots. In Group A acupuncture was carried out twice a week in the first two weeks and weekly in the next 6 weeks. A basic formula (LR3, SP6, LI4, GB20, GV20 and Ex-HN5) was always employed; additional points were selected according to each patient's symptomatology. The number of days with headache per month significantly decreased during treatment in all groups. The response in the groups differed over time, probably due to the different timing of applications of the three methods. TENS, lasertherapy and acupuncture proved to be effective in reducing the frequency of headache attacks. Acupuncture showed the best effectiveness over time.","Allais G, De Lorenzo C, Quirico PE, Lupi G, Airola G, Mana O, Benedetto C",Neurol Sci. 2003 May;24 Suppl 2:S138-42.,"Non-pharmacological approaches to chronic headaches: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, lasertherapy and acupuncture in transformed migraine treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12811613
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disorder (16% women, 6% men) associated with high direct and indirect costs. We evaluated the diagnostic and paramedical therapeutic measures by estimating the expenditure per patient and the effect of treatment.METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1000 patients attending the Essen outpatient headache centre in 1995. A total of 293 patients responded, of whom 165 were eligible and could be evaluated. Patients were asked to report diagnostic tests, paramedical treatments applied, average duration of success (defined as meaningful reduction in migraine frequency) and costs of paramedical therapy.RESULTS: Paramedical methods of therapy most frequently used were acupuncture, special pads, relaxation methods and herbal therapy. A total of 579 (3.5 on average) diagnostic procedures such as brain or cervical spine CT and MRI or EEG was performed. The average cost for acupuncture was 465 US dollars, while the success was maintained for 3.2 months. 1510 US dollars was spent on psychotherapy, which was successful for 1.7 months. Patients spent 93 US dollars for relaxation methods, achieving migraine relief for 7.4 months.CONCLUSION: Paramedical treatments lack scientific proof, while both acute and prophylactic treatment strategies have been successfully tested in many clinical trials. Paramedical treatment shows a good temporally effect in individual patients.","Gendolla A, Pageler L, Diener HC",Schmerz. 1999 Jun 11;13(3):196-200.,[Migraine costs and success of non-medicamentous therapy procedures.

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the degree of reporting of clinical details in a selected sample of 30 randomized control trials (RCT) on acupuncture efficacy for the treatment of migraine/headaches (n = 11) and for nausea/vomiting (n = 19). Additional goals included the assessment of the quality of randomization of the trials, and the assessment of the degree of reporting of information about the outcome measures used in each trial.METHODS: A checklist of 50 clinical details selected on the basis of a previous survey was used to evaluate the degree of reporting of information about patients, practitioners, diagnosis, and acupuncture treatments presented in each RCT. The likelihood of bias in the randomization process was assessed using a previously validated scale. Information about reliability/validity and clinical significance of the outcome measures used in each trial was assessed in terms of fully, partially, or not reported, with no attempt to evaluate their quality or appropriateness.RESULTS: In this sample of RCTs an average of 38.7% of important clinical details per trial were either fully or partially reported by researchers, the lowest being 26.4% for the migraine/headaches group. Studies with better quality of randomization were not more likely to report important clinical details. Only five studies (16.7%) provided information about reliability and validity of the outcome measures used, and only four studies (13.3%), all from the migraines/headache group, discussed the clinical significance of the outcome measures selected.CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of 30 RCTs of acupuncture efficacy for the treatment of migraines/headache and nausea/vomiting, researchers neglected to report adequately on important clinical details, and often did not discuss the reliability, validity, and clinical significance of the outcome measures used in the trials, thus rendering potential readers of the articles unable to critically appraise them from a clinical standpoint. In addition, the fact that the quality of randomization of the trials was totally unrelated to the degree of reporting of clinical details renders potential reviewers of these studies unable to establish valid conclusions about acupuncture efficacy based on the general quality of the methodological design. In the future, all areas of clinical acupuncture research need to be reviewed in a similar manner, and recommendations about proper reporting of important clinical details and proper discussion of the validity, reliability, and clinical significance of the outcome measures used in each trial should be made. Only then could this research be used to generate meaningful evidence-based recommendations for the contemporary practice of acupuncture.","Elorriaga Claraco A, Hanna SE, Fargas-Babjak A",J Altern Complement Med. 2003 Feb;9(1):151-9.,Reporting of clinical details in randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for the treatment of migraine/headaches and nausea/vomiting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12676043
"AbstractIt is presently unknown what the real impact of clinical acupuncture research on practitioners is, or what kind of specific information clinicians need to find on a published paper in this field.OBJECTIVES: To develop a pilot survey instrument to evaluate clinicians' information needs when reading acupuncture research papers, and then to use it to assess the relative importance that specific clinical details may have for clinicians when reading papers on the areas of acupuncture treatment for migraine/headaches and nausea/vomiting.METHODS: The survey instrument consisted of a list of 50 clinical details grouped in four areas: practitioners, patients, diagnostic procedures, and acupuncture treatment. Questions about the relative importance of these details regarding acupuncture research in general, and on the areas of migraine/headaches and nausea/vomiting in particular, were answered by 34 medical acupuncture practitioners attending a conference.RESULTS: Most clinical details were deemed important, with the highest rating for details concerning the acupuncture treatment (M = 3.25 +/- 0.43 on a scale from 0 = not at all important to 4 = very important), and diagnostic procedures (M = 2.91 +/- 0.33). Similar results applied to the research on migraine/headaches and nausea/vomiting.CONCLUSION: For acupuncture clinical research to have a real impact in daily practice, researchers need to be sensitive to the needs of clinicians and provide enough information about clinical details on the published papers.

"AbstractMigraine is a common neurological disorder that afflicts > or = 12% of the adult US population. Severe, frequent and disabling attacks require effective prophylaxis. Traditional preventive drugs such as beta-blockers, antidepressants and calcium antagonists, despite their documented efficacy, fail to offer relief for a significant proportion of migraine sufferers. Multiple threads of research over the last 15 years have led to the concept that migraine is generated from a hyperexcitable brain. This opens new perspectives in terms of preventive options, especially regarding the anticonvulsants agents. Additionally, different groups of substances, some of which nominated as non-orthodox agents, have been recently subjected to clinical trials and found to be effective. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the new options for migraine prevention.","Bigal ME, Krymchantowski AV, Rapoport AM",Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2003 Apr;4(4):433-43.,New developments in migraine prophylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12667107
"AbstractPain that does not respond to conventional treatment procedures makes it necessary to look for alternative methods. Acupuncture is an ancient procedure with empirical effects on pain. Previous studies established the increased output of messengers at neuronal junctions in spinal cord and hypothalamic locations, especially of endorphins which inhibit the perception of pain. We treated several painful symptoms with acupuncture and evaluated the outcome of the treatment. Patients with various kinds of therapy-refractory pain and patients in whom conventional treatment methods could not be applied were included in the study. The diagnoses included glaucoma. Tolosa-Hunt-Syndrome, ophthalmic migraine, blepharospasm, and dry eyes. In one case acupuncture was used for analgesia during surgery. Acupuncture was performed with sterile disposable needles, at points known to have an empirical analgesic effect. The stimulation was adapted to the patient's individual needs. VAS assessments before and after acupuncture were compared. The t-test was used for statistical evaluation. Acupuncture had no side effects, but reduced pain to a variable extent. Especially in cases of severe pain and in surgery, very effective pain reduction was achieved. In general, pain was significantly reduced in all patients by the use of acupuncture.

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To investigate whether acupuncture is superior to placebo and equivalent to sumatriptan for the early treatment of an acute migraine attack.DESIGN: Randomized, partly double-blind (sumatriptan versus placebo) trial.SETTING: Two hospitals in Germany (one specialized in traditional Chinese medicine and one in the treatment of headache).SUBJECTS: A total of 179 migraineurs experiencing the first symptoms of a developing migraine attack.INTERVENTIONS: Traditional Chinese acupuncture, sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneously) or placebo injection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of patients in whom a full migraine attack (defined as severe migraine headache) within 48 h was prevented. In patients who developed a migraine attack in spite of early treatment, acupuncture and sumatriptan were applied a second time, whilst patients initially randomized to placebo received sumatriptan.RESULTS: A full migraine attack was prevented in 21 of 60 (35%) patients receiving acupuncture, 21 of 58 (36%) patients receiving sumatriptan and 11 of 61 (18%) patients receiving placebo (relative risk of having a full attack 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64-0.99) for acupuncture versus placebo, and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62-0.98) for sumatriptan versus placebo). Response to the second intervention in patients who developed a full attack was better with sumatriptan (17/31 patients who received sumatriptan twice and 37/46 patients who had had placebo first) than with acupuncture (4/31). The number of patients reporting side-effects was 14 in the acupuncture group, 23 in the sumatriptan group and 10 in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial acupuncture and sumatriptan were more effective than a placebo injection in the early treatment of an acute migraine attack. When an attack could not be prevented, sumatriptan was more effective than acupuncture at relieving headache.","Melchart D, Thormaehlen J, Hager S, Liao J, Linde K, Weidenhammer W",J Intern Med. 2003 Feb;253(2):181-8.,Acupuncture versus placebo versus sumatriptan for early treatment of migraine attacks: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12542558
"AbstractThere is a need for large scale, pragmatic trials of complementary and alternative medicine in a primary care setting to answer questions about the 'real world' effectiveness of such methods. Randomisation and treatment in such trials should be prospective, but retrospective recruitment is possible, especially in chronic conditions. This involves contacting patients who have previously consulted their GP (identified through GP database searches) rather than encouraging GPs to refer patients as they present. We describe a prospective randomised trial of acupuncture for chronic headache, currently underway, as an example of retrospective recruitment. A pilot study of recruitment and recruitment modelling was undertaken. The target sample size was 300, 26% (n = 36) of general practices approached took part in the study, 32 completed the required database search. Practices used diagnostic term searches, prescription searches, or a combination of both. On average 1.7% of the total practice populations were identified as headache consulters, letters were sent to 4128 patients. 12% of identified patients were randomised (n = 401). Retrospective recruitment methods are feasible for CAM trials in chronic, stable conditions modelling can provide accurate data for planning such studies. Retrospective recruitment can be more efficient than prospective, further research is required on the generalisibility of results from populations recruited in this way.","McCarney R, Fisher P, van Haselen R",Complement Ther Med. 2002 Jun;10(2):63-8.,Accruing large numbers of patients in primary care trials by retrospective recruitment methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12481953
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: In a randomized controlled trial extending over 6 months, we evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture versus flunarizine in the prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura.METHODS: One hundred sixty women with migraines were randomly assigned to acupuncture treatment (group A, n = 80) or to an oral therapy with flunarizine (group F, n = 80). In group A, acupuncture was carried out in weekly sessions for the first 2 months and then once a month for the next 4 months. The same acupoints were used at each treatment: LR3 Taichong, SP6 Sanyinjiao, ST36 Zusanli, CV12 Zhongwan, LI4 Hegu, PC6 Neiguan, GB20 Fengchi, GB14 Yangbai, EX-HN5 Taiyang, GV20 Baihui. In group F, 10 mg flunarizine were given daily for the first 2 months and then for 20 days per month for the next 4 months.RESULTS: The frequency of attacks and use of symptomatic drugs significantly decreased during treatment in both groups. The number of attacks after 2 and 4 months of therapy was significantly lower in group A than in group F, and analgesic consumption was significantly lower in group A at 2 months of treatment. At 6 months no such differences existed between the two treatment groups. Pain intensity was significantly reduced only by acupuncture treatment. Side effects were significantly less frequent in group A.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture proved to be adequate for migraine prophylaxis. Relative to flunarizine, acupuncture treatment exhibited greater effectiveness in the first months of therapy and superior tolerability.","Allais G, De Lorenzo C, Quirico PE, Airola G, Tolardo G, Mana O, Benedetto C",Headache. 2002 Oct;42(9):855-61.,Acupuncture in the prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura: a comparison with flunarizine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12390610

"AbstractEvidence of effectiveness is increasingly used to determine which health technologies are incorporated into public health provision. Acupuncture is a popular therapy that has been shown to be superior to placebo in the treatment of nausea and dental pain, and promising for migraine and osteoarthritis of the knee. For many other conditions, such as chronic pain, in which acupuncture is often used, the evidence is either insufficient or negative. Misleading results may occur for a number of reasons. False negative results may arise from inadequate treatment schedules and inappropriate control interventions. This consensus document considers these issues with the aim of improving the design of efficacy trials of acupuncture in order that they are more likely to be conclusive and more meaningfully interpreted. Clinical trials of acupuncture must use an optimal form of treatment; this can be defined by examining standard texts, by surveying and consulting experts. There are a great many variables in treatment (such as point selection, form of stimulation) all of which need to be addressed in designing and reporting clinical trials. The control procedure is determined by the precise research question that is being addressed. For efficacy studies, in which the question is whether acupuncture has specific effects (i.e. is superior to placebo), sham forms of acupuncture appear the most appropriate method of controlling for needle penetration. A recent development of blunted, telescopic needles may represent a major advance. Such procedures may produce a therapeutic response so should preferably be recorded as 'sham' procedures rather than true 'placebo' controls. Blinding in clinical trials is an accepted means of reducing bias. Patient blinding in acupuncture studies can be achieved by sham procedures and its success should be measured. While practitioner blinding is difficult, though not impossible, blinding of the observer and the analyst should be considered as the ideal for all studies. A number of recommendations are made which aim to improve the quality of sham-controlled acupuncture studies.","White AR, Filshie J, Cummings TM, International Acupuncture Research Forum",Complement Ther Med. 2001 Dec;9(4):237-45.,"Clinical trials of acupuncture: consensus recommendations for optimal treatment, sham controls and blinding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12184353

"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is the complementary treatment most commonly used by general practitioners. This study describes the use of acupuncture among Norwegian general practitioners trained in acupuncture.MATERIAL AND METHODS: By telephone or mail, a questionnaire was presented to 212 general practitioners who had completed training in complementary acupuncture. They were asked to describe the use and effect of acupuncture and their attitude towards acupuncture.RESULTS: Of the 111 physicians who replied (53%), 67 (60%) used acupuncture in their clinical practice. 78% had acupuncture courses of less than four weeks' duration only. 52% stated that acupuncture was the preferred treatment in more than 5% of their patients. About 70-80% used acupuncture as a supplement to conventional treatment. Acupuncture was commonly used in patients with musculoskeletal pain (93%), migraine (66%), and headache (63%), less often in patients with nausea, allergy, anxiety, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal disorders. Improvement was reported in approximately three out of four patients. Lack of time was regarded as the major limitation to the use of acupuncture.INTERPRETATION: Many general practitioners trained in complementary acupuncture use acupuncture as an integrated part of their clinical practice.","Aanjesen T, Senstad AC, Lystad N, Kvaerner KJ",Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2002 Apr 10;122(9):921-3.,[Acupuncture--a complementary treatment in general practice].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12082836

"AbstractIn the last years an increase of allergic diseases has been observed whose prevalence is about 20-30% in general population of western countries. However there is a risk of an over diagnosis of allergic diseases as many different diseases (migraine, chronic urticaria, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic-fatigue syndrome etc.) are considered due to food allergy or intolerance. In many patients the diagnosis is based on the results of alternative diagnostic tests such as the cytotoxic test, the provocation/neutralization sublingual or subcutaneous test, the heart-ear reflex test, the kinesiology, the biorisonance, the electro-acupuncture, and the hair analysis, or on immunological tests (immunocomplex or specific food IgG). We reviewed the scientific evidences of these tests (specificity, sensibility, rationale, reproducibility). According to most studies none of them had to be recommended as useful for the diagnosis of food allergy or intolerance. Physicians should alert patients about the risk of an indiscriminate use of these test in the diagnosis of food allergy. In fact the use of an incorrect diet could be dangerous, particularly in childhood, as recently shown.","Senna G, Gani F, Leo G, Schiappoli M",Recenti Prog Med. 2002 May;93(5):327-34.,[Alternative tests in the diagnosis of food allergies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12050918

"AbstractComplementary therapies are widely used and play an important role in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. This review summarizes the evidences from randomized controlled trials for the effectiveness of a number of complementary therapies in migraine prophylaxis. The largest number of studies (a total of 15) is available for acupuncture. These studies are very heterogeneous in respect to interventions, methodological quality and outcome measurement, and the results are partly contradictory. The majority of trials, however, suggests that acupuncture is effective in migraine prophylaxis. The four existing, randomized and placebo-controlled trials on individualized homeopathy have shown conflicting results; clearly positive results have been reported only in the oldest, qualitatively least convincing study. Concerning herbal medicines the evidence is promising for extracts from Tanacetum parthenium (feverfew, five trials) and Petasites hybridus (one trial). Randomized trials on spinal manipulation for migraine prophylaxis have shown contradictory results. For neural therapy or complex strategies combining several complementary therapies only uncontrolled studies could be identified. In summary, there is promising evidence for the effectiveness of a number of complementary treatment options in migraine prophylaxis. Further research is clearly warranted.",Linde K,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz. 2002 May;45(5):425-9. doi: 10.1007/s00103-002-0406-3.,Gibt es Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit komplementärmedizinischer Therapien für die Migräneprophylaxe?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682554

"AbstractWe aimed to investigate: (1) whether patient and intervention characteristics, design-independent quality aspects, and response rates differ between randomized and non-randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic headache; (2) whether non-randomized studies provide useful additional information (regarding long-term effects, prognostic factors, adverse effects, and generalizability); (3) reasons for potential differences in response rates. Studies including at least five patients and reporting clinical outcome data were identified through searches in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, other databases and checking of bibliographies. Twenty-four randomized trials and 35 non-randomized studies (five non-randomized controlled cohort studies, 10 prospective uncontrolled studies, 10 case series, and 10 cross-sectional surveys) met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous regarding patients, interventions, outcome measurements and results. On average, randomized trials had smaller sample sizes, met more quality criteria, and had lower response rates (0.59 [95% confidence interval 0.48-0.69] vs. 0.78 [0.72-0.83]). Whether randomized or not, studies meeting more quality criteria had lower response rates. Non-randomized studies did not have significantly longer follow-up periods, three included an analysis of prognostic variables, only one reported on adverse effects, and the degree of generalizability was unclear. In the case of acupuncture for chronic headache, non-randomized studies confirmed the finding of a systematic review of randomized trials that the treatment is likely to be effective but provided little relevant additional information on long-term effects, prognostic factors, and adverse effects.","Linde K, Scholz M, Melchart D, Willich SN",J Clin Epidemiol. 2002 Jan;55(1):77-85.,Should systematic reviews include non-randomized and uncontrolled studies?

Less common indications included stroke rehabilitation, Bell's palsy, cholelithiasis, tinnitus, insomnia, migraine, and visceral pain. In North America, acupuncture is primarily for pain relief. Other uses include stroke rehabilitation, various emetic problems, migraine, and various addictions.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is most frequently used in China and North America for pain relief.

"AbstractAlternative or complementary modes of treatment often lack scientific proof of efficacy. This is true for many drugs that are used for prophylaxis of headaches as well. Many of these complementary modes are inexpensive, harmless, and possibly effective.

The patient must decide which of these approaches is appealing, affordable, and realistically doable.",Mauskop A,Med Clin North Am. 2001 Jul;85(4):1077-84.,Alternative therapies in headache.

"AbstractNutrition support in gastroparesis begins with encouraging smaller volume, low-fat, low-fiber meals and, if necessary, liquid caloric supplements. There should be a low threshold for placing a jejunal feeding tube either by laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. Parenteral nutrition should be used only briefly during hospitalization and not encouraged or sustained as an outpatient. Metoclopramide is now the prokinetic of choice for patients who can tolerate this agent; subcutaneous administration is an important method that allows for continued guaranteed absorption. Low-dosage erythromycin also has a prokinetic role alone or in combination with metoclopramide. Domperidone, a centrally acting antiemetic and prokinetic, is only be available to US citizens who can access sources in Canada or Mexico. Antiemetics should be used extensively because nausea is a very severe debilitating symptom, which is under-appreciated and under-treated by physicians. We recommend scopolamine patches to gain maximal absorption, in spite of vomiting and unpredictable oral intakes. The 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists ondansetron and granisetron are the most powerful agents. Relief bands using the P6 acupuncture point are useful adjunct. Special vigilance should be paid to situations that can undermine medical therapy or result in breakthrough symptoms, such as hyperglycemic events in patients with diabetes, migraine headaches, cyclic nausea and vomiting, menstrual cycles, rumination syndrome (psychogenic vomiting), and elevated herpes simplex titers. Most excitingly, the era of gastric electrical stimulation has arrived for patients not responding to standard medical therapy. The dramatic improvement in nausea and vomiting, as well as a sustained evidence of improved quality of life, gastric emptying, nutritional status, and decreased hospitalizations by this device are documented by long-term follow-up of more than a year for patients in this country and world-wide.","McCallum RW, George SJ",Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol. 2001 Apr;4(2):179-191.,Gastric Dysmotility and Gastroparesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11469976
"AbstractBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is widely used for the treatment of headache, but its effectiveness is controversial.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether acupuncture is: - more effective than no treatment - more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture - as effective as other interventions used to treat idiopathic (primary) headaches.SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the database of the Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine. We also contacted researchers in the field and checked the bibliographies of all articles obtained.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing acupuncture with any type of control intervention for the treatment of idiopathic (primary) headaches were included.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information on patients, interventions, methods, and results was extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a pre-tested standard form. Results on headache frequency and intensity were summarized descriptively. Responder rate ratios (responder rate in treatment group/responder rate in control group) were calculated as a crude indicator of results for sham-acupuncture-controlled trials. Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible due to trial heterogeneity and insufficient reporting.MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six trials including a total of 1151 patients (median, 37; range, 10-150) met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen trials were conducted among patients with migraine, six among patients with tension-type headache, and four among patients with various types of headaches. The majority of trials had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings. In eight of the 16 trials comparing true and sham (placebo) acupuncture in migraine and tension-type headache patients, true acupuncture was reported to be significantly superior; in four trials there was a trend in favor of true acupuncture; and in two trials there was no difference between the two interventions. (Two trials were uninterpretable.) The 10 trials comparing acupuncture with other forms of treatment yielded contradictory results.REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the existing evidence supports the value of acupuncture for the treatment of idiopathic headaches. However, the quality and amount of evidence are not fully convincing. There is an urgent need for well-planned, large-scale studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture under real-life conditions.","Melchart D, Linde K, Fischer P, Berman B, White A, Vickers A, Allais G",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2001;(1):CD001218.,Acupuncture for idiopathic headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11279710

Conversely, the evaluation of physical forms of treatment, including acupuncture, has special difficulties, and certain parameters in the study design need consideration. Acupuncture methods need individualization, a carefully selected placebo (""minimal acupuncture"" seems to be best), and the crossover design must have adequate time between the two treatment periods. Clinical trials that evaluate acupuncture frequently are characterized by several inadequacies (including some from these evaluating headaches), but it seems that additional clinical research is necessary to confirm its efficacy and to clarify its indications.","Manias P, Tagaris G, Karageorgiou K",Clin J Pain. 2000 Dec;16(4):334-9.,Acupuncture in headache: a critical review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11153790

"AbstractProphylactic treatment is mainly intended to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. It is usually proposed to patients who suffer from two or more attacks per month. It should also be considered in patients who suffer from less frequent, but prolonged, disabling attacks with a poor response to abortive treatment, and who consider that their quality of life is reduced between attacks. Excessive intake of acute medication, more than twice a week, is a strong indication for prophylactic treatment. In order to obtain a good compliance to treatment, the patient must be informed of the expected efficacy of the drugs, and of their most frequent side effects. Thus, the choice of a prophylactic drug is made together with the patient. Based on the results of published controlled trials, the main prophylactic drugs are some betablockers, methysergide, pizotifene, oxetorone, flunarizine, amitriptyline, NSAIDs, and sodium valproate. Some less evaluated drugs such as aspirin, DHE, indoramine, verapamil, may be useful. Other substances such as riboflavin and new antiepileptic dugs are being evaluated. The choice of the drug to start with depends on several considerations. The first step is to make sure that there are no contra indications, and no possible interaction with the abortive medications. Then, possible side effects will be taken into account, for example, weight gain is a problem for most young women and patients who practice sports may not tolerate betablockers. Associated pathologies have to be checked. For example, a hypertensive migraine sufferers may benefit from betablockers; in a patient who suffers both from migraine and tension type headaches or from depression, amitriptyline is the first choice drug. The type of migraine should also be considered; for instance, in frequent attacks with aura, aspirin is recommended and betablockers avoided. In most cases, prophylaxis should be given as monotherapy, and it is often necessary to try successively several drugs before finding the most appropriate one. Doses should be increased gradually, in order to reach the recommended daily dose, only if tolerance permits. The treatment efficacy has to be assessed after 2 or 3 months, during which the patient must keep a headache diary. If the drug is judged ineffective, an overuse of symptomatic medications should be checked, as well as a poor compliance, either of which may be responsible. In case of a successful treatment, it should be continued for 6 or 12 months, and then, one should try to taper off the dose in order to stop the treatment or at least to find the minimum active dose. Relaxation, biofeedback, stress coping therapies, acupuncture are also susceptible to be effective in migraine prophylaxis.",Massiou H,Rev Neurol (Paris). 2000;156 Suppl 4:4S79-86.,[Prophylactic treatments of migraine].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11139754
"AbstractAcupuncture is a valuable method of complementary medicine with broad application in neurology. It is based on the experiences of traditional Chinese medicine as well as on experimentally proven biological (biochemical and neurophysiological) effects. Acupuncture-induced analgesia is mediated by inhibition of pain transmission at a spinal level and activation of central pain-modulating centers by release of opioids and other peptides that can be prevented by opioid antagonists (naloxone). Modern neuroimaging methods (functional MRI) confirmed the activation of subcortical and cortical centers, while transcranial Doppler sonography and SPECT showed an increase of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen supply in normal subjects. Clinical experience and controlled studies confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture in various pain syndromes (tension headache, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, posttraumatic pain, lumbar syndrome, ischialgia, etc.) and suggest favorable effects in the rehabilitation of peripheral facial nerve palsy and after stroke. Appropriate techniques, hygiene safeguards and knowledge of contraindications will minimize the risks of rare side effects of acupuncture which represents a valuable adjunction to the treatment repertoire in modern neurology. There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its pathophysiology and clinical value.",Jellinger KA,Wien Med Wochenschr. 2000;150(13-14):278-85.,[Principles and application of acupuncture in neurology].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11075428

"AbstractThe objective of this study is to survey attitudes to, and use of acupuncture in the general Norwegian population. An anonymous questionnaire was dispatched to a random sample of 1100 in the general population, and 653 responded (60.7%). Nineteen per cent of the general population, most often suffering from musculo-skeletal pain, had tried acupuncture treatment. Lack of effect of conventional medicine was most often given as the reason to try acupuncture. Acupuncture patients had tried other kinds of alternative medicine twice as often as others, most often homeopathy (P<0.01). Acupuncture patients visit their GP more often (P<0.01), and are more concerned about own health (P<0.01) than patients who have not tried acupuncture. Sixty-six per cent say they benefited from acupuncture, and 7% report that the acupuncture treatment had adverse effects. Fifty-six per cent of those with experience of acupuncture felt that doctors should recommend acupuncture for migraine patients, and 34% of those never having tried acupuncture agreed (P<0.01). Both patients who had tried acupuncture and those who had not, felt that the doctor should not interfere in the cancer patient's wish to try acupuncture.","Norheim AJ, Fønnebø V",Complement Ther Med. 2000 Sep;8(3):187-92.,A survey of acupuncture patients: results from a questionnaire among a random sample in the general population in Norway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11068349
"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence of clinical effectiveness of subcutaneous CO2 insufflations (SCIs). STUDY LOCATION: The entire databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE Excerpta Medica (Field: Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine) and the Cochrane Library were screened for data up to August 1999. In addition, other potentially relevant journals were handsearched and references were checked.STUDY SELECTION: Uncontrolled observational trials (UCOTs) with sample sizes of at least n = 100, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Outcomes had to be patient-centered. English-, Czechoslovakian-, and German-language papers were considered.DATA ANALYSIS: For all study types, a criteria-based analysis was performed. For controlled trials only, quality was quantitatively assessed with the Jadad and Maastricht Scales.RESULTS: Thirteen studies (5 RCTs, 2 CCTs, and 6 UCOTs) were included. Mean scores on the Jadad and Maastricht Scales were 2 (Maximum 5) and 37 (Maximum 100), respectively. SCIs were found to be effective in addition to standard physical therapy in ""peripheral arterial occlusive disease"" (2 RCTs) and ""stable angina pectoris"" (1 RCT) and superior to sham needling for migraine headaches (1 RCT). There were no differences among SCIs and CO2 gas baths (1 RCT) or combined interventions, including SCIs (2 CCTs). All 6 UCOTs showed marked longitudinal effects.CONCLUSIONS: The low number and quality of the available studies precludes firm conclusions on the clinical effectiveness of SCIs.","Brockow T, Hausner T, Dillner A, Resch KL",J Altern Complement Med. 2000 Oct;6(5):391-403.,Clinical evidence of subcutaneous CO2 insufflations: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11059501

"AbstractThis study was carried out in 120 patients affected by migraine without aura, treated in 4 public health centers and randomly divided into acupuncture group (AG) and conventional drug therapy group (CDTG). The evaluation of clinical results was made 6 and 12 months after the beginning of treatment and was worked out as well according to socio-medical parameters. Acupuncture was applied to the following points: Touwei (ST 8), Xuanlu (GB 5), Fengchi (GB 20), Dazhui (GV 14), Lieque (LU 7), treated with the reducing method. In AG, the figure scoring the entity and frequency of migraine attacks drops from 9,823 before treatment to 1,990 6 months after and 1,590 12 months after; while in CDTG, it drops from 8,405 before treatment to 3,927 6 months after and 3,084 12 months after. In AG, the total absence from work amounted to 1,120 working days/year, with a total cost (private + social costs) of 186,677,000 Italian liras. In CDTG, the absence from work amounted to 1,404 working days/year, with a total cost of 266,614,000 Italian liras. If we consider that in Italy the patients affected by migraine without aura are around 800,000, and that acupuncture therapy is able to save 1,332,000 Italian liras on the total average cost supported for every single patient, the application of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine without aura would allow a saving of the health expenses in Italy of over 1,000 billion liras.","Liguori A, Petti F, Bangrazi A, Camaioni D, Guccione G, Pitari GM, Bianchi A, Nicoletti WE",J Tradit Chin Med. 2000 Sep;20(3):231-40.,Comparison of pharmacological treatment versus acupuncture treatment for migraine without aura--analysis of socio-medical parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11038990

"AbstractIn February 1997 a questionnaire on alternative medicine was distributed to 172 physicians, 374 nurses and 96 clerks, all employed in hospitals in the northern part of Norway. A response rate of 57% was achieved. The aim of the study was to compare different health professions regarding views on and use of alternative medicine. Among all respondents 56% described themselves as having a positive attitude towards alternative medicine (16% of the physicians, 71% of the nurses and 72% of the clerks). Twelve percent of physicians, 32% of nurses and 46% of clerks had been using alternative medicine. Female physicians and female nurses showed a more positive attitude and were more frequent users of alternative medicine than their male counterparts. Physicians had confidence in acupuncture, herbs and diets, mainly as treatment of muscle-skeletal disorders, and migraine. Nurses and clerks on the other hand tended to believe in various alternative methods against a broad range of disorders. Female physicians and nurses emphasised the importance of more information, knowledge and openness towards alternative treatments more than their male counterparts. They also believed that traditional medicine could benefit from adopting principles from alternative medicine.","Risberg T, Kolstad A, Johansen A, Vingerhagen K",In Vivo. 1999 Nov-Dec;13(6):493-8.,"Opinions on and use of alternative medicine among physicians, nurses and clerks in northern Norway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10757043
"AbstractINTRODUCTION: Despite its increasing use as a complementary therapy to treat pain, acupuncture is rarely considered by pediatricians, in part due to perceptions that it will not be acceptable to pediatric patients. We wished to describe pediatric pain patients' experience with acupuncture treatment for chronic pain.DESIGN: Retrospective case series.METHODS: Subjects were pediatric pain patients referred by the Pain Treatment Service at Children's Hospital in Boston, who went to a pediatric acupuncturist. A research assistant not involved in the patient's care conducted the survey by telephone. Data were analyzed qualitatively and descriptively.RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 47 families were reached by telephone; all agreed to be interviewed. Patients had a median age of 16 years at the time of referral, 79% were female, and 96% were white. The most common three diagnoses were migraine headache (n = 7), endometriosis (n = 6), and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (n = 5). Patients had a median of 8 treatments (range: 0-60) within 3 months (range: 0-48 months); 85% of families paid out-of-pocket. Acupuncture therapies included needle insertion (98%), heat/moxa (85%), magnets (26%), and cupping (26%). Most patients and parents rated the therapy as pleasant (67% children/60% parents), and most (70% children/59% parents) felt the treatment had helped their symptoms; only 1 said that treatment made symptoms worse.CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with chronic, severe pain found acupuncture treatment pleasant and helpful. Additional, prospective studies are needed to quantify the costs and effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for pediatric pain.","Kemper KJ, Sarah R, Silver-Highfield E, Xiarhos E, Barnes L, Berde C",Pediatrics. 2000 Apr;105(4 Pt 2):941-7.,On pins and needles?

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To assess whether there is evidence that acupuncture is effective in the treatment of recurrent headaches.DESIGN: Systematic review.STUDY SELECTION: Randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing acupuncture with any type of control intervention for the treatment of recurrent headaches.DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register), personal communications and bibliographies.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information on patients, interventions, methods, and results were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a pretested form. A pooled estimate of the responder rate ratio (responder rate in treatment group/responder rate in control group) was calculated as a crude indicator of trial results as meta-analysis of more specific outcome data was impossible due to heterogeneity and insufficient reporting.RESULTS: Twenty-two trials, including a total of 1042 patients (median 36, range 10-150), met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen trials were in migraine patients, six in tension-headache patients, and in one trial patients with various headaches were included. The majority of the 14 trials comparing true and sham acupuncture showed at least a trend in favor of true acupuncture. The pooled responder rate ratio was 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.11). The eight trials comparing acupuncture and other treatment forms had contradictory results.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the existing evidence suggests that acupuncture has a role in the treatment of recurrent headaches. However, the quality and amount of evidence is not fully convincing. There is urgent need for well-planned, large-scale studies to assess effectiveness and efficiency of acupuncture under real life conditions.","Melchart D, Linde K, Fischer P, White A, Allais G, Vickers A, Berman B",Cephalalgia. 1999 Nov;19(9):779-86; discussion 765.,Acupuncture for recurrent headaches: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10595286
"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of complementary/alternative (CAM) therapies in the treatment of non-migrainous headache (i.e. excluding migraine, cluster and organic headaches).DESIGN: Systematic review with quality scoring and evidence tables.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of RCTs per therapy, quality scores, evidence tables.RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were identified in the categories of acupuncture, spinal manipulation, electrotherapy, physiotherapy, homeopathy and other therapies. Headache categories included tension-type (under various names pre-1988), cervicogenic and post-traumatic. Quality scores for the RCT reports ranged from approximately 30 to 80 on a 100 point scale.CONCLUSION: RCTs for CAM therapies of the treatment of non-migrainous headache exist in the literature and demonstrate that clinical experimental studies of these forms of headache can be conducted. Evidence from a sub-set of high quality studies indicates that some CAM therapies may be useful in the treatment of these common forms of headache.","Vernon H, McDermaid CS, Hagino C",Complement Ther Med. 1999 Sep;7(3):142-55.,Systematic review of randomized clinical trials of complementary/alternative therapies in the treatment of tension-type and cervicogenic headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10581824
"AbstractThis article reviews recent studies conducted in Europe which sought to evaluate the effectiveness of Peter Mandel's Esogetic Colorpuncture Therapy (ECT). These investigations addressed the use of specific ECT therapies for treating a variety of difficult health problems: migraines, childhood insomnia, bronchitis, ADD or learning disorders, and uterine fibroids. Limitations in research design and sample size necessitate that these studies be viewed as pilot or preliminary research. However, in all the studies, the findings showed dramatic improvement of symptoms after ECT treatments. This suggests that ECT may offer fast, economical, non-invasive and non-toxic methods for treating the selected health problems and that ECT continues to show promise as a powerful new method of wholistic healing.","Croke M, Bourne RD",Am J Acupunct. 1999;27(1-2):85-94.,A review of recent research studies on the efficacy of Esogetic Colorpuncture Therapy--A wholistic acu-light system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10513101
"AbstractLight therapy has a long history, dating from ancient Egypt to the contemporary treatment of seasonal affective disorder. In the early half of this century, Dinshah Ghadiali, MD PhD, refined a sophisticated system of color therapy. Influenced by a strong background in mathematics and physics, he determined specific ""attributes"" of the colors of the spectrum, i.e., their specific effects on human physiology. Later research has confirmed many of his concepts and spawned evolution of new systems for application of light therapy including irradiation of acupuncture points. According to the author, his system dovetails nicely with traditional Oriental medicine theory, relating colors to the internal organs and meridian system. Of particular note is recent Russian research which has shown that light is conducted within the body along the acupuncture meridians leading the authors to ponder: Do acupuncture meridians function as a light (photon) transferal system within the body, not unlike optical fiber? Case studies provide support for the clinical benefits of light therapy. The emerging contemporary color therapy systems of Mandel (Colorpuncture) and McWilliams (Chromo-pressure) are discussed, and a newly patented device is introduced.",Cocilovo A,Am J Acupunct. 1999;27(1-2):71-83.,"Colored light therapy: overview of its history, theory, recent developments and clinical applications combined with acupuncture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10513100

"Abstract1. The fact that 25% of the German population have the problem of headache, or migraine is uniquely characteristic of Germany. The administration of analgesics which used to be their local treatment for the problem can neither give a radical cure nor avoid certain side effects. 2. It can be seen from the therapeutic result of a 80% effective rate in 89 cases of migraine that acupuncture treatment is an effective therapy for ""German migraine"" without any side effects. 3. Since 10% of the migraine cases were related to the improper sleeping posture, due attention should be paid and appropriate measures be taken to prevent occurrence of headache. 4. While receiving acupuncture treatment, the cases of migraine related to menstruation should also try to regulate their emmeniopathy. 5. It seems somewhat difficult for acupuncture treatment to give good effects in those with migraine related to psychological pressures and in those given long-term administration of contraceptives. This needs to be further studied.",Hu J,J Tradit Chin Med. 1998 Jun;18(2):99-101.,Acupuncture treatment of migraine in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10437224

"Abstract1466 Norwegian working doctors under 71 y of age were surveyed in February 1994 on their attitudes to acupuncture and experience as acupuncture patients. 1135 doctors responded (response rate: 77%). More than 8% had undergone acupuncture treatment and 38% of these reported benefit from the treatment. Over 53% would realistically consider acupuncture if they got problems or diseases where acupuncture treatment could be an alternative. More than 38% recommend acupuncture treatment to their migraine patients. More than four out of five doctors would not try to interfere with a patient's wish to try acupuncture treatment for cancer. 81% said that acupuncture is, or should be integrated in the national health care system. More general practitioners held this view than other doctors (p < 0.001). Positive attitudes were strongest among doctors who either had already undergone acupuncture treatment or intended to do so.

"AbstractOBJECTIVE: To provide physicians and allied health care professionals with guidelines for the nonpharmacologic management of migraine in clinical practice.OPTIONS: The full range and quality of nonpharmacologic therapies available for the management of migraine.OUTCOMES: Improvement in the nonpharmacologic management of migraine. EVIDENCE AND VALUES: The creation of the guidelines followed a needs assessment by members of the Canadian Headache Society and included a statement of objectives; development of guidelines by multidisciplinary working groups using information from literature reviews and other resources; comparison of alternative clinical pathways and description of how published data were analysed; definition of the level of evidence for data in each case; evaluation and revision of the guidelines at a consensus conference held in Ottawa on Oct. 27-29, 1995; redrafting and insertion of tables showing key variables and data from various studies and tables of data with recommendations; and reassessment by all conference participants.BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Augmentation of the use of nonpharmacologic therapies for the acute and prophylactic management of migraine is likely to lead to substantial benefits in both human and economic terms.RECOMMENDATIONS: Both the avoidance of migraine trigger factors and the use of nonpharmacologic therapies have a part to play in overall migraine management.VALIDATION: The guidelines are based on consensus of Canadian experts in neurology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, psychology and family medicine, and consumers. Previous guidelines did not exist. Field testing of the guidelines is in progress.","Pryse-Phillips WE, Dodick DW, Edmeads JG, Gawel MJ, Nelson RF, Purdy RA, Robinson G, Stirling D, Worthington I",CMAJ. 1998 Jul 14;159(1):47-54.,Guidelines for the nonpharmacologic management of migraine in clinical practice.

"AbstractHistorically, review of migraine-related vestibular symptoms has focused on the various clinical presentations that occur and the results of diagnostic studies of vestibular function. Treatment of vestibular symptoms related to migraine has been proposed similar to that used for headache control, but few examples of the effectiveness of this therapy have been published. The purpose of this study is to present the various approaches that can be used to manage vestibular symptoms related to migraine, and to evaluate the overall effectiveness of these treatment approaches. This was a retrospective review of 89 patients diagnosed with migraine-related dizziness and vertigo. The character of vestibular symptoms, pattern of cochlear symptoms, results of auditory and vestibular tests, and comorbidity factors are presented. Treatment was individualized according to symptoms and comorbidity factors, and analyzed regarding effectiveness in control of the major vestibular symptoms of episodic vertigo, positional vertigo, and nonvertiginous dizziness. Medical management included dietary changes, medication, physical therapy, lifestyle adaptations, and acupuncture. Complete or substantial control of vestibular symptoms was achieved in 68 (92%) of 74 patients complaining of episodic vertigo; in 56 (89%) of 63 patients with positional vertigo; and 56 (86%) of 65 patients with non-vertiginous dizziness. Similarly, aural fullness was completely resolved or substantially improved in 34 (85%) of 40 patients; ear pain in 10 (63%) of 16 patients; and phonophobia in 17 (89%) of 19 patients. No patient reported worsened symptoms following medical management. The conflicting concept of a central disorder (migraine) as the cause of cochlear and vestibular dysfunction that often has peripheral features is discussed.",Johnson GD,Laryngoscope. 1998 Jan;108(1 Pt 2):1-28.,Medical management of migraine-related dizziness and vertigo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9430502
"AbstractWe investigated the effectiveness of acupuncture in childhood migraine in 22 children with migraine, randomly divided into two groups: a true acupuncture group (12 children) and a placebo acupuncture group (10 children). Ten healthy children served as a control group. Opioid activity in blood plasma was assayed by two methods: (1) determination of total (panopioid) activity with an opiate radioreceptor assay, and (2) determination of beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity by radioimmunoassay. The true acupuncture treatment led to significant clinical reduction in both migraine frequency and intensity. At the beginning of the study, significantly greater panopioid activity was evident in plasma of the control group than in plasma of the migraine group. The true acupuncture group showed a gradual increase in the panopioid activity in plasma, which correlated with the clinical improvement. After the tenth treatment, the values of opioid activity of the true acupuncture group were similar to those of the control group, whereas the plasma of the placebo acupuncture group exhibited insignificant changes in plasma panopioid activity. In addition, a significant increase in beta-endorphin levels was observed in the migraine patients who were treated in the true acupuncture group as compared with the values before treatment or with the values of the placebo acupuncture group. The results suggest that acupuncture may be an effective treatment in children with migraine headaches and that it leads to an increase in activity of the opioidergic system.","Pintov S, Lahat E, Alstein M, Vogel Z, Barg J",Pediatr Neurol. 1997 Sep;17(2):129-33.,Acupuncture and the opioid system: implications in management of migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9367292
"AbstractPatients with chronic headache were offered treatment by acupuncture or massage with relaxation instead of a change in their prescribed medication. They were randomly allocated to either treatment. There was a significant improvement in pain ratings with both treatment types. Specifically a greater effect was seen in migraine patients treated by massage with relaxation when compared to acupuncture. No psychological factors were found to predict response to either treatment. At the end of the study, 13% of patients were significantly more worried that there may be a more serious cause underlying their headache despite reassurance and an improvement in their headache scores.","Wylie KR, Jackson C, Crawford PM",J Tradit Chin Med. 1997 Jun;17(2):130-9.,Does psychological testing help to predict the response to acupuncture or massage/relaxation therapy in patients presenting to a general neurology clinic with headache?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10437184
"AbstractAcupuncture is being increasingly used as one of the most important non-pharmacological therapies in treatment of chronic pain. Chronic headache, especially migraine and tension headache are diseases frequently encountered. In their treatment acupuncture is a method with very few side effects and is a remarkable alternative or addition in the whole concept of treatment. Open and placebo-controlled studies have shown that acupuncture reduces the frequency and intensity of headache in many patients, as well as the use of drugs. The success rates achieved of about 50-85% are comparable to the results of other methods. In the case of migraine, especially good results are archived by prophylactic treatment with acupuncture during the pain-free period. The concept of treatment depends on the basic rules of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Selection of the acupuncture points is primarily determined by the pain site. Long-term success could be confirmed by follow-up examinations six to eighteen months after end of the therapy.",von der Laage D,Schmerz. 1997 Feb 25;11(1):4-8.,[Acupuncture for headache].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12799832
"AbstractA scientific evaluation of complementary medical practices commonly used in healthcare is urgently required. Although randomized clinical trials are the primary tool for such an evaluation, for a number of conceptual and pragmatic reasons, they should not be the only tool. The authors propose systematic clinical auditing as a concept to (1) provide information on the ""epidemiology"" of complementary medical practices, (2) make the processes used in the daily practice of these complementary methods clearly intelligible, and (3) give a preliminary estimation of outcomes. Systematic clinical auditing uses mainly observational studies of large samples of patients. A pilot study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using a systematic clinical audit in a hospital for traditional Chinese medicine in Germany. All 1597 patients admitted between February 1, 1992, and August 31, 1993, were included in the study. Patients' characteristics, diagnoses, and preventive and therapeutic interventions were recorded, and patients were asked to rate the intensity of their main complaints (on scale of 1 to 10) at admission; at discharge; and at 2, 6, and 12 months after admission. About two thirds of all patients had chronic pain complaints; the most common diagnosis was migraine (n = 244). Nearly all patients received acupuncture and Chinese herbal therapy; 61% received tuina massages, and 16% received qigong. The mean intensity of main complaints was 7.0 (2.0, SD) at admission, 4.6 (2.4) at discharge, and 5.5 (2.7) 12 months after admission. In the authors' opinion, systematic clinical auditing is a valuable tool for collecting basic information on structural characteristics, processes, and outcomes in complementary medicine and for determining representative and relevant questions for future randomized clinical trials.","Melchart D, Linde K, Liao JZ, Hager S, Weidenhammer W",Altern Ther Health Med. 1997 Jan;3(1):33-9.,"Systematic clinical auditing in complementary medicine: rationale, concept, and a pilot study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8997802

"AbstractAcupuncture is now being increasingly used in the treatment of headache. Acupuncture is a technique originating in Asia, from countries that have a cultural background with a fundamentally different concept of disease and therapy. Up to now, sustained application of acupuncture in Western medicine has been impeded by the lack of a scientifically convincing explanation of the mechanisms of action in terms of neurobiological criteria. Acupuncture is being used empirically in the treatment of migraine; clinical studies have been published. A definitive evaluation of acupuncture based on well-founded clinical experimental studies has yet to be made. The investigation was carried out in migraine patients who were divided into two subgroups in a control group design with two different stimulation techniques. The verum group was treated with the correct point location, normal prick depth and elicitation of a needle sensation. The control group received treatment at points that are far away from the acupuncture points, using a superficial prick technique and without eliciting a needle sensation. The effect of therapy was appraised by means of headache diaries with subsequent interference statistical and individual case analysis. In the present study comprising 81 patients, the incidence of the attacks was significantly reduced in both subgroups. The effect of acupuncture treatment was of comparable magnitude to that of the beta-blocker metoprolol. The advantage of acupuncture treatment consists in the lack of side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms or an increase in weight. A minor side effect was only reported in one case. In the data analysis with the interference statistical method, verum acupuncture was superior to the control in only one subgroup. The possibility that the addition of further points (distant points) can explain this effect on the basis of the hypothesis of a central modulation of the migraine process is discussed. Acupuncture shows a sufficiently pronounced and sustained therapeutic effect for its use to be considered in a possible interval treatment of migraine.",Weinschütz T,Schmerz. 1996 Jun 17;10(3):149-55.,[Acupuncture in headache therapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12799862

"AbstractAlthough Tianrong acupoint (SI 17) is used for migraine headache, its mechanism of action remains obscure. The effects of Tianrong acupoint therapy on neurogenically-mediated plasma protein extravasation (125I-BSA) in rat dura mater induced by electrical stimulation of the right trigeminal ganglion was studied. When the unilateral trigeminal ganglion was stimulated (5 Hz, 1.2 mA, 5 msec for 5 min), the ratio of stimulated side/unstimulated side (cpm/mg) was 1.6663 +/- 0.0217. The plasma extravasation was blocked by different kinds of treatment in different degrees. The order of the ratio was as follow: Tianrong acupoint therapy (1.0917 +/- 0.0266) and Tianrong electrical needle therapy (1.1281 +/- 0.0227) < Tianrong acupoint injection with normal saline (1.325 +/- 0.0444) < Quchi acupoint (LI 11) injection with prednisolonum (1.5284 +/- 1.1624).

"AbstractApproximately 12% of the population suffers from migraine. This sudden, usually unbearable headache can last for up to 72 hours and can be accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Prophylactic treatment is recommended if more than three attacks of headache occur monthly. For prophylactic therapy, beta-blockers or the calcium antagonist flunarizine are mostly used. Serotonin blockers, which have undesirable side-effects, and dihydroergotamine, which can only be used for a short time as well as non-steroidal antirheumatics and antidepressants and relaxation exercises are used more rarely. The literature reports on the successful treatment of migraine with acupuncture.

"AbstractThrough the treatment of 65 cases of painful diseases with electroacupuncture, in comparing with the analgesic effect of contralateral stimulation (CS) and ipsilateral stimulation (IS), it was verified that IS and CS had the similar effect on pain-relieving, while CS was better in improving motor impairment. By testing the rat's pain threshold and recording the neuronal activity in the D-PAG, it was found that neither IS nor CS could increase the pain threshold in the unilateral D-PAG lesioned rats, and the excited neuronal discharge was recorded in the unilateral D-PAG by stimulating rat's Zusanli (ST 36) at each side. It indicates that IS and CS might share the same high level afferent pathway in acupuncture analgesia in CNS.","Fang JQ, Liu YL, Mo XM",Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 1994 Oct;14(10):579-82.,[Clinical and experimental studies on analgesic effects of ipsilateral and contralateral stimulations with electro-acupuncture].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7719086

"AbstractOBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of dry needling of myofascial trigger points in the neck region to metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis.DESIGN: Randomized, group comparative study. patients, investigator and statistician were blinded as to treatment, the therapist was blinded as to results.SETTING: Outpatient pain clinic in the northern Copenhagen area. Patients were referred by general practitioners or respondents to newspaper advertisements.SUBJECTS: Included were patients with a history of migraine with or without aura for at least 2 years. Excluded were persons with contraindications against treatment with beta blockers, chronic pain syndromes, pregnancy or previous experience with acupuncture or beta-blocking agents. A total of 85 patients were included; 77 completed the study.INTERVENTIONS: After a 4-week run-in period, patients were allocated to a 17-week regimen either with acupuncture and placebo tablets or to placebo stimulation and metoprolol 100 mg daily.RESULTS: Both groups exhibited significant reduction in attack frequency (P < 0.01). No difference was found between the groups regarding frequency (P > 0.20) or duration (P > 0.10) of attacks, whereas we found a significant difference in global rating of attacks in favour of metoprolol (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Trigger point inactivation by dry needling is a valuable supplement to the list of migraine prophylactic tools, being equipotent to metoprolol in the influence on frequency and duration (but not severity) of attacks, and superior in terms of negative side-effects.","Hesse J, Møgelvang B, Simonsen H",J Intern Med. 1994 May;235(5):451-6.,Acupuncture versus metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis: a randomized trial of trigger point inactivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8182401

"AbstractIn February 1992, 80% of the medical students at Tromsø University filled in a questionnaire concerning attitudes to acupuncture. 63% of the students would recommend acupuncture when the diagnosis was migraine, while 14% of the students would support a patient who tried acupuncture as cancer therapy. 86% of the students thought that placebo could account for 25-50% of the effect of acupuncture. Most of the students wanted more scientific documentation, although 75% said that acupuncture already was, or at least should be, part of the ordinary health care system. The main result of this study was a generally positive attitude towards acupuncture.

"Abstract30 patients with chronic migraine received needle acupuncture after investigation of personality traits, cognitive and social factors. Treatment response was evaluated in two different ways (documentation of attacks in a migraine diary and subjective judgment of outcome). Diary documentation showed that the frequency of attacks was halved, with no essential relation to psychological factors. Short duration of illness was the best predictor of a good response to therapy. Patients' subjective judgement demonstrated a mean improvement of 60%. Unlike diary documentation, the subjective response rates were closely related to personality traits. In particular, patients with high scores for extroversion and low scores for neuroticism reported a better response.

"AbstractAcupuncture has been used in the treatment of a variety of illnesses for more than 2000 years. The practice of acupuncture is based on a theoretical system different from our understanding of human anatomy and physiology, and has developed through experience and observation. Stimulation of selective acupoints (situated along 'meridians' in the body) by inserting needles is believed to restore bodily functions by promoting the flow of 'vital energy', throughout the system. Other forms of stimulation which have been developed are heat, electrical stimulation, magnetism and, recently, laser. Laser acupuncture offers distinct advantages over the traditional method because the procedure is pain-free and non-traumatic. Clinical applications include the control of pain in osteoarthritis, lumbago and migraine, and anaesthesia for certain surgical procedures, as well as other ailments of the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems. The technique is easy to learn and there is no need for sophisticated instruments. Thus it is especially useful in developing countries where health resources are limited.","Wong TW, Fung KP",Fam Pract. 1991 Jun;8(2):168-70.,Acupuncture: from needle to laser.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1874364
"AbstractSubstance abuse has been reported frequently in chronic headache patients. The problem exists in most Western countries. Abuse of various compounds frequently leads to a state of dependency. Prescription as well as over-the-counter agents are often abused. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine are the most frequently abused compounds. Butalbital, ergot alkaloids, NSAIDS, and narcotic and oral or intranasal sympathomimetics are often abused. Patients with chronic daily headache complain of symptoms that may suggest a mixed-type headache. Features of migraine and muscle contraction headache often coexist in these individuals. It has been suggested that the most frequent cause for the transformation of a periodic headache into a daily headache is substance abuse. Substance abuse and drug dependency have multiple causes, and the etiology will reside with the compounds that are used to excess. The problem may arise as a result of poor instructions from the physician, improper diagnosis with gradual escalation in amounts of drug consumed, or a reinforcement mechanism and a brain stimulation-reward effect. The brain reward system has been studied with narcotics and psychomotor stimulants. It may be activated to a lesser degree with ergotamine, barbiturates, and other abused substances. The long-term effects of substance abuse are contingent on the compounds that are used. They may result in organ damage, medical complications, vascular injury, and a refractory state with chronic headache that eludes successful management of the headache disorder. Patients exhibit a less-than-satisfactory quality of life and are often depressed. Treatment includes outpatient care in cooperative, less dependent patients. Often patients will require inpatient management in order to discontinue use of the abused agents. Pharmacologic agents, behavior modification, psychotherapy, dietary intervention, and acupuncture may be necessary to treat the patient. Each patient must be treated by an interested physician, and the patient will require one or more of the preceding measures for a successful outcome. Often abused compounds must be discontinued in order to obtain a satisfactory response in an individual with chronic headache.",Elkind AH,Med Clin North Am. 1991 May;75(3):717-32.,Drug abuse and headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2020225

"AbstractSixty-two female patients with chronic tension headache were randomized into two treatment groups--acupuncture and physiotherapy. The intensity of headache, muscle tenderness and neck mobility was assessed before and after treatment. Thirty healthy women were used for comparison. Before treatment it was found that muscle tenderness was increased and neck rotation was reduced in the patient group compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between the intensity of headache and muscle tenderness. After treatment, the intensity of headache and muscle tenderness were reduced in both treatment groups. The headache was more improved in the physiotherapy group, and there was a marked reduction in the intake of analgesics. The tenderness was reduced in all muscles tested in the physiotherapy group but only in some of the muscles after acupuncture. The limitation of neck rotation was not influenced by either treatment.","Carlsson J, Fahlcrantz A, Augustinsson LE",Cephalalgia. 1990 Jun;10(3):131-41.,Muscle tenderness in tension headache treated with acupuncture or physiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2245458

"AbstractIdiopathic headaches are probably the most common problem in schoolchildren. The prevalence increases up to 70% in 14-year-old adolescents, with migraines ranging from 10% to 20%. Tension headaches are often understandable on a psychosocial and behavioral basis; in migraine, however, a familial disposition of 60%-80% is well known. Migraine in childhood is initially more common in boys; after puberty girls predominate. At the beginning of migraine development the headache is often not hemisymptomatic in children. Attack duration is shorter than in adults and often lasts less than 4 h. Irreversible neurological deficits are extremely seldom and only occur as ophthalmoplegic attacks in infants. In general, diagnostic studies in headache patients can be restrcted to a neurological examination and electroencephalography. Acute treatment of migraine should include environmental isolation and analgesics such as acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol; sometimes antiemetic drugs may be useful before. In refractory cases one should try ergotamine. Only a few controlled studies on the prophylaxis of migraine in children have been reported. The first substance introduced in the prophylactic regime was the beta-blocker propranolol. According to results in adults, further optimization could be expected by using thebeta (1)-specific agent metoprolol. New investigations have shown significant efficacy of the calcium antagonist flunarizine as well as low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. Dihydroergotamine drops, often used in pediatric practice, have not proved superior to placebo; the lack of side effects may, however, allow use of the substance as a first-line strategy in staged prophylaxis. In case of failure, nonpharmacological methods such as acupuncture may be tried, especially in older and cooperative children. Vasoconstriction training has been studied in some children; other biofeedback methods and behavioral strategies including relaxation and hypnosis have proved as effective. Follow-up of spontaneous migraine courses in children has shown, that 60% are still or again suffering from migraine as adults. It is presently unknown, whether pharmacological prophylaxis during several months followed by attack-free periods of months or years may influence the long-term prognosis. For tension headaches, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has produced good improvement in recent investigations in about 3/4 of cases; full remissions were possible in most cases. A combination of relaxation and behavioral therapy should be recommended where possible, especially in cases of therapeutic resistance.",Pothmann R,Schmerz. 1990 Mar;4(1):7-13.,[Headache in children.].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18415208
"AbstractA randomised controlled trial comparing true and sham acupuncture was conducted on 30 patients suffering from chronic migraine.

"AbstractPharmacotherapy of migraine is not satisfying at present, especially in case of frequent attacks of headache. Therefore alternative methods of treatment gain increasing relevance. Based upon many years of experience with specific reflexotherapy and conventional stimulation therapy for treatment of pain we started a clinical study in migraine applying the punctual transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PuTENS) performed with self-made pocket electrostimulators (TRG I-III). The study includes self-treatment of patients at home. After more than 6 months PuTENS was prophylactically effective in 225 out of 282 patients, i.e. in 80% of cases the frequency of attacks and the use of drugs were reduced to at least 50%. In 90 patients treated by the physician the rate of improvement was 86% compared to 76% in 192 patients, which performed self-treatment according to the physician's instruction and under medical supervision. 96 out of 160 patients with migraine could alleviate their acute headache by PuTENS applying the pocket electrostimulator at home. In conclusion, PuTENS is superior to drug therapy and conventioned electrotherapy in the treatment of migraine. Its effectiveness is similar to needle acupuncture. The method can therefore be regarded as a valuable alternative and help for patients with frequent headache.",Heydenreich A,Psychiatr Neurol Med Psychol (Leipz). 1988 Dec;40(12):717-23.,[Punctate transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in migraine therapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3266675
"AbstractChronic and frequently relapsing headaches as well as myalgic-vertebragenic pain syndromes belong to the most frequent pain diseases. Among the non-medicamentous methods the techniques of the aimed reflex and stimulation therapy such as acupuncture, neural therapy and manual medicine particularly stood the test. As a non-invasive alternative we try to replace the needle acupuncture by punctuate transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. With the help of self-constructed pocket stimulating current devices we treated 740 patients suffering from pain (420 with myo-vertebragenic and 320 with primary headaches) and achieved 90% of immediate successes and 70-80% improvement after 6 months. The treatments could be objectifie thermometrically. Own prospective randomized studies of placebo-treatment and medicamentously controlled studies of treatment and changes of the pain threshold by means of the PuTENS were briefly represented and the mechanism of action was discussed.

"AbstractThe long term effect of one series of acupuncture treatments on migraine headache was investigated. Twenty-five patients (20 women, 5 men) with a mean migraine history of 22 years and a stable, severe migraine (mean frequency 8 days/28 days) completed the study, out of 30 originally enrolled. The patients recorded the presence, severity and duration of headache as well as drug consumption during three 12 weeks long periods: one pretreatment period (baseline period = BP), follow up period I (FU I) immediately following the treatment period of 6-8 weeks and follow up period II (FU II) starting the 25th post treatment week. An index for migrainous headache was calculated for each 28 day period (number of days times severity rated 1, 2 or 3). Acupuncture was given close to or in the region of the headache. During FU I and FU II the migraine index had decreased 40% and 39%, respectively, compared to BP (to 10.3 and 10.5 from 17.2), giving a statistical significance with p less than 0.01. The number of days with migraine headache was reduced 35 and 34%, respectively, during FU I and FU II to 5.1 and 5.2 from 8.0 days/28 days during BP. This reduction is significant too with p less than 0.05 and was responsible for almost the whole reduction of the index. Thus the severity of the pain was not much changed.

"AbstractIn patients with functional ophthalmological disturbances classical acupuncture therapy was compared to a technique of inserting the needles close to superficial nerves. Seventy-five patients with migraine, 47 patients with functional blepharospasm, 18 with trigeminal neuralgia, and 9 with posttraumatic pain syndromes were treated. Treatment comprised seven sessions at four-day intervals. Of 62 patients undergoing classical acupuncture, 21 (33.9%) were subsequently free of complaints and 33 (53.2%) felt a great improvement. Nerve points were stimulated in 83 patients, 31 (38%) of whom were completely free of symptoms after treatment, and 45 of whom (54%) felt much better. Hence, there was no marked difference between the two methods as regards therapeutic effect. These results support the concept of acupuncture therapy being a combination of dermal stimulation and suggestion. The therapeutic approach to pain or blepharospasm by use of the mainly suggestive effects of acupuncture is recommended only if underlying organic diseases can be ruled out.","Sold-Darseff J, Leydhecker W",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1986 Aug;189(2):167-9.,[Acupuncture for pain in the cranial region and for blepharospasm without organic cause].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3761996

"AbstractThe study compares in a randomized clinical control-group design with a waiting list-and acupuncture therapy control-group the short term (three months) effectiveness of a newly developed psychological biobehavioral treatment program in 30 chronic migraine patients. The results show a significant reduction of vascular and tension related headache-frequency and intensity (primary outcome criteria) in both the acupuncture and psychological treatment condition. The waiting list control-group remained almost unchanged over the whole observation period. The improvement in both treatment conditions remained stable throughout the post therapy period to the three months follow-up, but only the psychological treatment condition revealed a highly significant reduction in the use of all kinds of medication in comparison to the pre-treatment period. Single case analyses showed a slight superiority of the psychological treatment condition over the acupuncture therapy due to a more generalized improvement in all secondary outcome variables (psychological restrictions in every day life, medication, duration of headache). The effect of specific components of the psychological treatment program are examined and possible general implication for a treatment of severely disturbed chronic migraine patients are discussed.","Doerr-Proske H, Wittchen HU",Z Psychosom Med Psychoanal. 1985;31(3):247-66.,[A muscle and vascular oriented relaxation program for the treatment of chronic migraine patients.

"AbstractIn 48 patients with chronic migraine and muscle tension headaches, a comparison was made between a prophylactic course of acupuncture and of medical treatment. It was intended that all patients should have 3 months with both forms of treatment, but 19 were unwilling to change from one form of prophylaxis to the other. Twenty-four of 41 patients improved on acupuncture, the improvement being very marked in nine; nine of 36 patients improved on medical treatment, the improvement being marked in three. Of the 29 patients who changed from one form of treatment to the other, a larger proportion preferred acupuncture to medical treatment. A beneficial response to acupuncture was more likely when the patient had local tender muscular points. The presence of depressive features did not preclude satisfactory treatment with acupuncture. No major side effects were encountered with acupuncture.","Loh L, Nathan PW, Schott GD, Zilkha KJ",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 1984 Apr;47(4):333-7.,Acupuncture versus medical treatment for migraine and muscle tension headaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6726258

"AbstractThe study of serotonin levels in the blood of 49 patients with migraine and and migrainous headaches revealed both elevations and decreases in its concentrations as compared to the average physiological norm, which seems to be occasioned by various severity of the disease course. In the majority of patients in the period of disease exacerbation prior to the treatment, the initial concentrations of blood serotonin were lowered. Acupuncture normalizes increased and slightly decreased levels of serotonin which is in agreement with a good and stable clinical response. At the same time acupuncture fails to affect considerably reduced levels of serotonin and only transient clinical improvement occurs in such cases. Thus, the determination of serotonin blood levels in patients with migrainous cephalgias may be employed in the assessment of the severity of the disease course and the prognosis of acupuncture effectiveness.","Markelova VF, Vesnina VA, Malygina SI, Dubovskaia LA",Zh Nevropatol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 1984;84(9):1313-6.,[Changes in blood serotonin levels in patients with migraine headaches before and after a course of reflexotherapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6334421

"AbstractThis study was planned as a pilot study to determine to what extent acupuncture might help in severe cases of migraine and, if possible, to see whether the mechanism was endorphin mediated. The study was carried out on 16 subjects who had severe and regular migraine for more than five years (mean duration 24 years). The study lasted eight months and was divided into four blocks of two months each: pre-treatment, treatment block I, treatment block II, and post-treatment. It was double-blind and cross-over in design. Acupuncture was found to cause a significant change in the number of headaches and their duration, with 40% of the subjects showing a 50%-100% reduction. Although pain sensation was not altered, attacks were less severe and less often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. At no stage was there any difference between subjects receiving saline or naloxone so that the possibility of a non-endorphin mechanism must be considered.","Lenhard L, Waite PM",N Z Med J. 1983 Aug 24;96(738):663-6.,Acupuncture in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches: pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6576263

"AbstractClinical and electrophysiological examinations of 255 children and adolescents with migraine were carried out. Some age peculiarities of the clinical picture and course of the disease were noted. As the treatment method electropuncture with the use of Soviet-made apparatus pep-1 was given to 80 patients. A favourable clinical effect was registered that correlated with the electrophysiological findings. Indications for, and contraindications to the use of electropuncture for treating migraine in children and adolescents are determined.","Vesnina VA, Dubovskaia LA",Zh Nevropatol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 1983;83(10):1499-503.,[Treatment of migraine with electropuncture].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6606915

"AbstractEleven patients affected by common migraine (CM), eleven affected by daily chronic headache (DCH), and eight healthy volunteers were studied. Plasma levels of beta-endorphin (beta EP), beta-lipotropin (beta LPH). ACTH and cortisol were measured in basal conditions and after traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA). Basal beta LPH and beta EP plasma levels (pg/ml) in the DCH patients (57.6 +/- 9.5 and 16.8 +/- 2.5, respectively; M +/- SE) were lower than those found in the controls (83.6 +/- 13.7 and 26.0 +/- 6.1; p less than 0.001), while those found in the CM cases showed inter-mediate values (75.3 +/- 12.0 and 24.4 +/- 5.8). ACTH and cortisol concentrations in both the CM and DCH patients were in the same range as those of the control group. TCA caused an increase in beta LPH and beta EP plasma concentrations in the control group (beta LPH: 117 +/- 16.9; beta EP: 44.1 +/- 6.7). Opioid plasma levels, however, remained unmodified after TCA in both the CM and DCH groups. ACTH plasma levels remained stable after TCA in all three subject groups. Patients suffering from primary headache are characterized by low beta LPH and beta EP plasma levels and by a poor reactivity of circulating opioids to non-stressful stimuli.","Facchinetti F, Nappi G, Savoldi F, Genazzani AR",Cephalalgia. 1981 Dec;1(4):195-201.,Primary headaches: reduced circulating beta-lipotropin and beta-endorphin levels with impaired reactivity to acupuncture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6290071
"Abstract29 of 84 mostly out-patients were submitted to a single treatment with 6-8 (if necessary -10) blocks of the superior cervical ganglion over a period of about 21/2 weeks. The remaining 55 patients were submitted to repeated treatment with 6 (if necessary -8) blocks within the course of the following years. The incidence of the migraine-attacks decreased in both groups to an average of less than 6 to less than 1 per month, most of the (first) intervals of freedom from attacks lasted 1/2-3/4 of a year and extended to 1 year and more if the treatment was continued; about no more nausea and/or vomiting was reported.

"AbstractThe reported own experiences are related to acupuncture with injections of 10% NaCl solution (irritating the nerve endings) into selected points. Since 1973 this method was applied in 171 patients with radicular painful syndromes and 120 patients with headaches. In a group of 107 cases of sciatic pain a persistent analgesic effect was achieved in 30 cases (28%) and immediate disappearance of pain occurred in 21 cases (20%). In a group of 64 patients with shoulder pains a persistent effect was obtained in 36 cases (56%) and immediate but transient in 7 (10,9%). Among 43 patients with migraine a persistent good effect was observed in 24 cases (55,8%) and an immediate relief which was transient in 9 cases (20,9%). In 77 cases of vasomotor headaches a persistent effect was noticed in 37 patients (48%) and an immediate transient one in 23 (29,8%). It is not absolutely necessary to insert the needles into the traditional points accepted in classic acupuncture. During one procedure from 3 to 10 needles were inserted leaving them for about 15 minutes. From 3 to 15 procedures were given, mostly on consecutive days until a significant effect was obtained.","Domzał T, Kwasucki J, Zaleska B",Neurol Neurochir Pol. 1980 May-Jun;14(3):259-62.,[Acupuncture in headache and radicular syndromes].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7412983

"AbstractThe authors report the results of treatment with a modification of acupuncture associated with chemical stimulation in 144 patients with painful radicular syndromes and headaches. In 57 cases sciatic pains were present, in 21 cases shoulder pains, in 20 migraine and in 46 vasomotor headaches. Permanent disappearance of pain, that is disappearance of pain during the procedure and lack of recurrence within several successive days, was obtained in about 40% of cases of radicular syndromes and in 62% of cases of headaches, early disappearance of pain for 3 to 48 hours after the procedure was obtained in 14% of radicular syndromes and nearly 26% headaches, while improvement, that is reduction of pain intensity, was achieved in 29.5% of radicular pains and 3% of headaches, while in 15.3% of cases of radicular syndromes and 9% of cases of headaches no improvement was observed. Both vasomotor headaches and neuralgias belong to the group of nervous system diseases in which pain is the basic and sole symptom, while treatment includes its removal. In these cases acupuncture is a valuable analgesic method. The presently reported results agree with those in the literature on the use of classical acupuncture and its modifications. It is worth stressing that insertion of needles into the traditional points used in classical acupuncture is without any greater importance was shown by the presently reported experiences (various points were used in the same case) as well as by the reports of other authors. The modification of acupuncture with addition of chemical stimulation has been tried by the authors for 4 years. A weak stimulus resulting from insertion of the needle and irritation of the nerve endings with concentrated sodium chloride acts similarly as mechanical or electrical irritation. The method is simple and completely safe.","Kwasucki J, Zaleska B, Gierczak J",Neurol Neurochir Pol. 1978 May-Jun;12(3):229-34.,[Modified acupuncture in the treatment of pain].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/683427

"Abstract191 migraine patients reported previous allergic diseases, tendency to vertigo and collapse, attacks of tachycardia, blood coagulation disorders, surgically treated cysts and fibromas and inflammatory diseases of various organs significantly more frequently than a control group similar in age, sex and social standing (N equal to 150). 140 patients reported retrospectively on the efficacy and side effects of different drugs. Ergotamine preparations showed a significantly better effect than others. The shorter the untreated attack, the more effective the preparations appeared to be. The younger the patients the better the effect of Dihydergot for interval treatment of migraine.

"AbstractAcupuncture has been claimed to be effective in restoring consciousness in some comatose patients. Possible mechanisms to explain alleged acupuncture-induced arousal may include vasodilatory effects caused by sympathetic stimulation which leads to an augmentation of cerebral microcirculation and thereby improves oxygen supply to the brain tissue. Experiments were performed in ten albino rats (Wistar) employing PO2 microelectrodes which were inserted into the cortex of the animals through small burholes. Brain tissue PO2 was continuously recorded before, during, and after acupuncture. Stimulation of certain acupuncture loci (Go-26) resulted in immediate increase of PO2 in the frontal cortex of the rat brain. This effect was reproducible. The effect was comparable to that obtained with increase of inspiratory CO2 known to induce arterial vasodilatation and thus capillary perfusion pressure. The effect was more significant as compared to tissue PO2 increases obtained after increase of inspiratory oxygen concentration from 21% to 100%. It appears that acupuncture causes an increase of brain tissue perfusion which may be, at least in part, responsible for arousal of unconscious patients. Dilatation of cerebral vascular vessels and improvement of autoregulation in the brain by acupuncture stimulation may also explain the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine headache.","Chen GS, Erdmann W",Comp Med East West. 1977 Summer;5(2):147-54.,Effects of acupuncture on tissue-oxygenation of the rat brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/608334
"AbstractAcupuncture techniques, primarily self-administered acupressure, were evaluated as symptomatic treatment for the pain of migraine, histamine cephalgia, and tension headaches. A twenty-four month study was conducted with a general neuropsychiatric outpatient practice of more than 500 patients, seen for more than 5000 outpatient visits; more than 200 patients had significant headache symptomatology. Appropriate pharmacologic, dietary and psychotherapeutic treatments were administered for underlying metabolic, neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The results of the study indicated that acupuncture techniques were reasonably effective in relieving the pain of migraine and tension headaches. Auto-acupressure replaced outpatient prescriptions for analgesics, ergotamine preparations, steroids, propanolol or methysgeride. The value of auto-acupressure was enhanced by its easy availability of application and lack of toxic effects.",Kurland HD,Dis Nerv Syst. 1976 Mar;37(3):127-9.,Treatment of headache pain with auto-acupressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1253662

"AbstractA course of 10 daily acupuncture treatments was given to 200 patients who suffered from chronic pain syndromes of at least one year duration and the result assessed at the end of the course of treatment and after an interval of at least 2 months. Treatments were individualized using needling of body loci distally and near the site of pain, and ear acupuncture. In 38 patients suffering from chronic headaches, including 13 cases of migraine-type headache, 81% reported an improvement in their condition, but only one patient was pain free for the 2-month observation period. In 162 patients with other chronic pain problems, 99 or 61% were improved or pain free at the end of treatment; in 69 of these a worthwhile degree of improvement persisted over the observation period of 2 months. Thirteen percent of all patients did not respond to acupuncture and in 26% the response was considered as transient only. Daily treatments are not more effective than weekly or biweekly treatments. Pain in the neck and shoulder region, in the knee and low back pain responded to acupuncture with prolonged improvement in over 50% of the patients treated. Facial pain syndromes and pain in the region of the trunk were least responsive and only 3 of 11 patients with post-herpetic neuralgia reported still having less pain after 2 months. Needling of effective loci and particularly ear needling often causes an instantaneous reduction or disappearance of pain; the speed of this response can only be explained by a mechanism within the nervous system. Based on our experience acupuncture represents a useful therapeutic modality in the management of pain.","Spoerel WE, Varkey M, Leung CY",Am J Chin Med (Gard City N Y). 1976 Autumn;4(3):267-79.,Acupuncture in chronic pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/135511

"AbstractThirty-three patients have been treated by acupuncture since July 8, 1974, using body loci, ear points and electrical stimulation. Of the 33 cases, 18 were female and 15 were male, ranging in age from 25 to 77 years. Sixteen patients suffered from migraines, 12 from tension headaches, 2 from cluster headaches, 1 from vascular headaches, and for 2 patients the etiology was uncertain. The duration of the headaches ranged from 3 months to 40 years. The patients received from 3 to 16 treatments. Of the 33 cases, 5 patients had only 3 treatments and 10 patients had 5 or less treatments. Eighteen patients had good results, i.e., no headache at all. Twelve patients had fair results, that is they sometimes had headaches, but they could be controlled with a few repetitions of treatment or by analgesics at a lesser dosage than they were taking at the beginning of treatments. Three patients had no response at all or poor results; however, these discontinued treatment before the author could evaluate whether they were actual absolute no-response cases. Of the 33 patients, 2 patients had a good response after only 2 treatments; 4 had a good response after 10 treatments. However, most of the patients had a good response after 6-8 treatments. A course of treatment usually requires 10 to 14 visits befor definite evaluation of the results can be made. It was observed that patients with fair or particularly poor results usually discontinued treatment too early and/or had concomitant conditions as well. Even though a longer period of time for follow-up is necessary before drawing any conclusions, results have already shown that acupuncture, perhaps, can be a valuable form of treatment for headaches.",Cheng AC,Am J Chin Med (Gard City N Y). 1975 Apr;3(2):181-5.,The treatment of headaches employing acupuncture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1124734
